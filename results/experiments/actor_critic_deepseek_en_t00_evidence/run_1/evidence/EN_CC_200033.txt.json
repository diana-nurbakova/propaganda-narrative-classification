      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism. Run your eye down the contributors to The Climate Book and you can see who she’s been reading: Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Naomi Klein. For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the motives and ideological underpinnings of the climate movement, framing it as an anti-capitalist political project rather than a genuine environmental effort."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly questions the motives behind the climate change agenda, characterizing it as a deceptive front for a radical political ideology, which fits the definition of criticizing the motives behind climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote presents the climate movement as a deceptive front with a hidden, radical political agenda to destroy Western civilization, aligning with the narrative of hidden plots or ulterior motives by a powerful ideological group."

      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly alleges that a central institution of the climate movement (COP) is a deceptive and corrupt enterprise, engaging in unethical practices like greenwashing and cheating."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "most Extinction Rebellion protesters are upper middle class snobs who do little but inconvenience and harm the working class.",
      "reasoning": "This is a direct personal attack on the character and motives of a key activist group within the climate movement, dismissing them as 'snobs' who harm ordinary people, rather than engaging with their arguments."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism... For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism... The climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "These statements support the parent narrative by framing the climate movement as a covert political project (radical leftism, anti-capitalism) using environmental concerns as a front, which is a distinct criticism not captured by the specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly alleges that the COP climate policy framework is a deceptive mechanism that enables false environmental claims ('greenwashing') and dishonest practices for gain, fitting the definition of policies driven by profit or corporate gain rather than genuine environmental concerns."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Only overthrow of “the whole capitalist system” will suffice.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies as being fundamentally inadequate and misdirected, arguing they are part of a flawed system that must be completely replaced. This radical critique of the policy framework's foundation does not fit the more specific definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly claims that the stated goal of the climate agenda (addressing climate change) is a facade for a different, hidden motive: advancing radical leftist ideology."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by alleging that a major international climate institution (COP) is a deceptive scheme run by powerful actors (implied elites within the system) to enable false environmental claims and corruption, which is a hidden plot not covered by the more specific subnarratives."

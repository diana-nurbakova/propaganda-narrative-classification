    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes NATO, a key Western diplomatic and military institution, portraying it as obsolete and a tool for aggressive American expansion, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Western diplomacy and policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "Most regional countries want none of it, but four Trojan horses – South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand – are ready to let them in",
      "reasoning": "The term 'Trojan horses' implies that these nations are secretly acting as conduits for a hidden agenda (NATO expansion into Asia) orchestrated by powerful Western/American groups, fitting the narrative of secret plots by powerful entities."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement undermines Ukraine's government and military actions by portraying them as callously sacrificing their own citizens, which attacks the legitimacy and intentions of Ukrainian leadership."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This predicts severe adverse outcomes (the start of a world war) as a direct consequence of American/Western actions, highlighting negative consequences for the West and the world."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly questions the reliability and truthfulness of Western mainstream media and official narratives, framing their output as 'nonsense' and part of a 'dis-information war,' which cultivates distrust towards these media sources."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "All this lunacy was on full display in Washington last week, at the Nato’s celebration of death and destruction with its 75th anniversary summit.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly characterizes NATO's actions and summit as 'lunacy' and a 'celebration of death and destruction,' portraying the West's response and military posture as disproportionate and hysterical, which fits the definition of 'overreacting.'"
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition, then expand it to Asia. It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote claims the West is willing to prolong the war for its own strategic benefit ('expand it to Asia') while callously dismissing Ukrainian lives as expendable ('just Ukrainian lives after all'), supporting the subnarrative that the West's interest is self-serving, not about Ukraine's fate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'proxy war in Ukraine' explicitly frames Ukraine's conflict as a war fought by the West using Ukraine as its instrument or puppet, which is a core element of the subnarrative discrediting Ukraine as a sovereign actor."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Most regional countries want none of it, but four Trojan horses – South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand – are ready to let them in",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the expansion of NATO into Asia as a covert operation enabled by internal collaborators ('Trojan horses'), suggesting a hidden plot by powerful groups (the West/NATO) using secret schemes (infiltration via allied nations)."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'proxy war' directly frames the conflict in Ukraine as a war fought by Ukraine on behalf of, and under the direction of, Western powers, portraying Ukraine as a puppet or instrument."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement portrays Ukraine's war effort as desperate, futile, and sacrificing its own population pointlessly, suggesting a hopeless situation with no positive outcome for Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war. Seriously.",
      "reasoning": "This sarcastic dismissal ('Seriously.') of the West's framing of China as the 'decisive enabler' supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by undermining the Western rationale for supporting it, but does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly supports the parent narrative by catastrophizing the negative consequences of Western actions, specifically framing the US/NATO expansion as actively starting a third world war, which is a severe negative consequence not covered by the more specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly equates 'mainstream newsrooms' with the 'corridors of power' in Western capitals, framing them as part of a unified 'disinformation war' effort whose narratives are not believed by the wider world. This discredits Western media institutions by portraying them as instruments of state propaganda."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Given his obvious mental decline, US President Joe Biden may be forgiven for claiming to ABC News’ host George Stephanopoulos that he was indispensable: “You know, not only am I campaigning, but I’m running the world.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by implicitly casting doubt on the media's role. It presents a major Western news interview (ABC News) as a platform for a leader portrayed as mentally unfit, suggesting the media is either complicit in amplifying dubious claims or failing in its duty to challenge them, which fosters distrust. This specific critique of media's handling of a political figure does not fit the more general definitions of the other provided subnarratives."

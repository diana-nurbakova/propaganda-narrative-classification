      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate cultists push bizarre scare language about weather: “rain bombs” and “boiling oceans”",
      "reasoning": "The opening phrase 'Climate cultists' and the description of their language as 'bizarre scare language' directly challenges the motives and communication tactics of the climate movement, framing it as irrational and fear-mongering."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "And not one of their predictions has come true. Global cooling, global warming, mass extinction, mass famine, the polar ice caps melting, mass flooding, the ozone layer depleted, etc.",
      "reasoning": "This quote from a commenter explicitly lists past climate-related predictions that allegedly failed, directly raising doubts about the reliability and accuracy of climate science and its forecasts."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for 'renewable energy,' meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the Inflation Reduction Act's climate policy funding, questioning its effectiveness by suggesting it will lead to a 'dark and cold future,' thereby challenging the policy's impact and outcome."

      "evidence_quote": "frightening the general public into giving up cheap and abundant energy in exchange for globalist 'green' energy.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase frames the shift to 'green' energy as a negative exchange driven by fear, expressing skepticism about the motives behind promoting these technologies and implying they are inferior to traditional energy sources."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Rain bombs? Bomb cyclones? Atmospheric rivers? They really are losing their minds,\" wrote a commenter about how all sorts of common weather events now have scary new names aimed at frightening the general public into giving up cheap and abundant energy in exchange for globalist \"green\" energy.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the climate movement for using exaggerated, frightening language ('scary new names') to describe common weather events, which aligns with the definition of alleging exaggeration for dramatic effect."

      "reasoning": "The statement attacks the integrity of a key climate activist (Al Gore) by alleging hypocrisy and unethical personal behavior, suggesting the movement is influenced by ulterior motives or corruption."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly discredits the scientific community by listing a series of failed predictions, implying scientists and their institutions are unreliable and their warnings should not be trusted."

      "evidence_quote": "\"I have been hearing about these end of the world scenarios since I was a kid. And not one of their predictions has come true. Global cooling, global warming...\"",
      "reasoning": "The statement lumps 'global warming' in with other failed predictions, directly implying that the data does not support the claim of a global temperature increase, as the prediction has not 'come true'."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that the predictions made by climate advocates, which form the basis for policy, have consistently failed to materialize, implying that policies based on these predictions are ineffective."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes a major climate policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) by framing its massive spending on renewable energy as leading directly to a dystopian outcome ('a very dark and cold future for humanity'). It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

It criticizes green technology policy but does not fit the specific definitions of dangerous, unreliable, costly, or nuclear energy not being climate friendly."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly attributes the 2015 crisis to both the Russian invasion and the policies of a former Ukrainian president, thereby partially shifting blame for Ukraine's economic difficulties onto a Ukrainian leader alongside the invader."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the conflict in stark moral terms, lauding the 'free world' (a term synonymous with the West) as the champion of democracy against tyranny, which aligns with the definition of excessively extolling the virtues and moral superiority of Western countries."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear by speculating about direct, catastrophic attacks on civilian infrastructure in major Western European capitals, suggesting the war will inevitably spread to the West if Ukraine does not prevail."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion.",
      "reasoning": "The statement makes a predictive assumption about the outcome of the war, linking debt restructuring to a higher likelihood of Ukrainian victory and the protection of the 'civilized world'."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly attributes the cause of Ukraine's 2015 economic crisis to two factors: Russia's invasion and the poor policies of a former Ukrainian president. By including the Ukrainian leader's policies as a cause alongside the invasion, it shifts a portion of the blame for the war's consequences away from the invader (Russia) and onto a Ukrainian actor, indirectly supporting the narrative that others share responsibility for the conflict's hardships."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All bondholders, except Russia, accepted this offer.",
      "reasoning": "This statement singles out Russia as the sole non-cooperative party in a past debt restructuring, framing it as an obstacle to Ukraine's financial stability. While not blaming the West for starting the war, it supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia's actions (refusing the deal) as a direct cause of negative outcomes for Ukraine, thereby blaming the war's economic consequences on the invader's specific, uncooperative behavior in the financial sphere."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine, and, first and foremost, Ukraine's membership in NATO.",
      "reasoning": "This quote overpraises the West by presenting NATO membership and the unity/support of the 'free world' as the paramount, well-known solution for victory, attributing exceptional and decisive power to Western institutions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This statement portrays the West ('the entire free world') as morally superior and aligned with justice, framing its victory over 'dictators and tyrants' as a victory for a just world order."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by overpraising the West's role in protecting its own civilized cities from a barbaric threat, implicitly crediting Western support for Ukraine as the shield that safeguards Western civilization itself."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly names European capitals (Amsterdam, Warsaw, Berlin, Prague) as potential targets for Russian missile strikes, evoking fear that the conflict will expand to directly threaten other countries."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The quote amplifies war-related fears by speculating about specific, horrific consequences (missile strikes on hospitals in European capitals) that are not covered by the more specific subnarratives like 'WWIII' or 'nuclear weapons'. It is a distinct fear-mongering statement."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army will lose all the occupied territories",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail' is a speculative statement about the potential outcome of the conflict, implying a Ukrainian victory which inherently means Russia would lose the territories it occupies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This statement speculates on a potential future war outcome (the prevention of missile strikes on European capitals) contingent on Ukraine's financial and military success. It supports the parent narrative of speculating on war outcomes but does not fit the specific definitions about army collapse or territorial loss."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia, the invader, and onto the West, accusing it of vetoing a peace agreement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "\"We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,\"",
      "reasoning": "The statement criticizes Western (European) politicians, accusing them of malicious intent (wanting war, not peace) and of acting against their own citizens' interests in a proxy conflict, which discredits Western diplomatic and military policy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear of a catastrophic, large-scale war spreading to Western Europe, threatening its destruction, which aligns with amplifying war-related fears."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "\"He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a 'US problem.'\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote makes a definitive prediction about the potential outcome of the conflict (EU cannot win) and re-frames the nature of the war, which constitutes speculation on war outcomes."

      "evidence_quote": "\"We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the conflict to the West, framing the war as a deliberate Western (specifically American) proxy war aimed at damaging Russia, with the EU complicit in fueling it."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the continuation of the war on the West's actions (vetoing a peace agreement), which is a form of blaming others, but it does not fit the specific definitions of 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' as it focuses on obstructing peace rather than initiating aggression."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Members of the European Parliament (EP) engaged in mutual insults during debates on the need for further support to Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly describes a conflict and division within the EU institution (the European Parliament) over a key policy issue (support for Ukraine), portraying it as unable to present a united front."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a “US problem.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly states the EU lacks the power ('no chance of winning') to confront Russia, directly supporting the narrative of Western (EU) weakness and impotence."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "“And you have the audacity to claim that this is assistance to Ukraine. The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims Western support is not driven by genuine care for Ukraine but by the self-serving interests (profits) of the arms industry, fitting the subnarrative definition precisely."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "\"We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly threatens the destruction of Western Europe ('level Western Europe to the ground') if support for Ukraine continues. This evokes a catastrophic, existential threat that strongly implies the potential for a major, possibly nuclear, conflict, aligning with the subnarrative of fearing the use of weapons of mass destruction or a devastating war."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by suggesting the West deliberately prolonged the war, thereby increasing the risk and scale of the conflict. It does not fit any of the other specific subnarratives (WWIII, Russia attacking others, nuclear weapons, NATO intervention)."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",

      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on a potential future outcome of the war: a pan-Slavic alliance forming and destroying Western Europe if support for Ukraine continues. It is a speculative war outcome that does not fit the specific definitions about the Russian or Ukrainian armies collapsing or losing territory."

      "reasoning": "The quote is a direct prediction about the potential future capture of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, by Russian forces, which fits the definition of speculating about war outcomes."

      "reasoning": "This statement glorifies Russia's territorial ambitions and asserts a historical and cultural claim over Odesa, portraying its potential annexation as a positive and rightful return, which constitutes praise of Russia's actions and character."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly speculates about a potential future outcome of the war, specifically the capture of Kyiv, which aligns with the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes but does not fit the specific definitions of 'Russian army is collapsing', 'Russian army will lose all the occupied territories', or 'Ukrainian army is collapsing'."

      "reasoning": "The quote frames Russian military action as a 'success' and portrays Ukrainian forces as being in 'chaos' and forced to flee, which positively highlights Russia's military effectiveness and scale of operations."

      "reasoning": "The statement portrays Russia as the rightful and welcoming home for Odesa, implying that being part of the Russian Federation is a positive, natural state that aligns with the city's history and identity, thus presenting Russia as a source of unity and belonging."

On the eve of its second anniversary, Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's, and a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by positively framing Russia's strategic position (increasing confidence, Ukraine being outnumbered/outgunned, Western aid being stalled), which praises Russia's advantageous situation, but does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "many people are growing annoyed with the actions of climate alarmists.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the actions and public perception of the climate movement, labeling them 'alarmists' and stating they inspire annoyance, which aligns with the narrative's definition of challenging the movement's impact and motives."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical statement '(it's not)' directly minimizes the significance and threat of man-made climate change, fitting the definition of downplaying its impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This statement raises doubts about the accuracy and reliability of climate science projections, directly questioning whether the predicted outcomes of global warming are occurring."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate protests will likely increase in the next two months, with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses the movement of exploiting normal seasonal weather ('normal heat of summer') to push exaggerated predictions ('global warming predictions that never seem to materialize'), fitting the definition of suggesting the movement exaggerates severity for dramatic effect."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "The most hated group in America (climate protestors) have STORMED THE GREEN at the 18th hole of the PGA Traveler’s tournament. SEND THEM TO JAIL…or bury them under the fairway. Whatevs.",
      "reasoning": "This statement attacks the reputation of climate activists as a group by labeling them 'The most hated group in America' and advocating for extreme punitive measures ('SEND THEM TO JAIL…or bury them'), which constitutes a direct ad hominem attack on key figures in the movement."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "One would think the goal of these groups would be to generate public sentiment for their cause; instead they have inspired the exact opposite. What they don't seem to understand is that not all attention is good attention.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the movement's strategy and effectiveness, arguing its actions are counterproductive and alienating the public. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Human activities do not impact climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "Less than half of Americans believe climate change is caused by human activity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly presents the idea that climate change is not primarily caused by human activity, aligning with the subnarrative definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "This parenthetical directly denies the legitimacy of the threat from man-made climate change, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting a more specific definition from the provided list."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Scientific community is unreliable",
      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda, blind belief in climate hysteria is on the decline.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate propaganda' and 'climate hysteria' directly discredits the scientific community and their communications, framing their work as manipulative and unreliable."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Data shows no temperature increase",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate protests will likely increase in the next two months, with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "The statement 'global warming predictions that never seem to materialize' directly asserts that the predicted temperature increases and climate impacts are not occurring, which aligns with the subnarrative that data does not show a temperature increase."

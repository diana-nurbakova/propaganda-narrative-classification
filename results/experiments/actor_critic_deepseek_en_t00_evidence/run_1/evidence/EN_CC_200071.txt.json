      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the economic impact of climate policies by attributing high costs for housing, fuel, and utilities to these 'green' policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "\"To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted,\" wrote Ring for American Greatness",
      "reasoning": "This quote, attributed to Edward Ring, challenges the intentions and actions of authorities (the Biden administration) by framing their climate agenda with skepticism ('allegedly') and scare quotes around 'climate crisis'."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program... to incentivize them to implement new building codes that \"lower greenhouse gas emissions\" and fight the so-called \"climate crisis.\"",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'so-called \"climate crisis\"' uses scare quotes to dismiss or minimize the significance and accepted reality of the climate crisis, which aligns with the narrative of downplaying climate change."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the implementation of green policies as a factor that weakens national strength and resilience in a geopolitical and military context, claiming they are instruments that harm geopolitical standing."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses strong skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies (wind, solar, biomass), labeling them as inefficient, expensive, environmentally destructive, and incapable of meeting energy demands."

      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring. \"And these elevated prices for essentials factor into price increases for everything else.\"",
      "reasoning": "This direct quote explicitly blames green policies for making housing, fuel, and utilities unaffordable, and links these higher costs to broader price inflation, directly supporting the subnarrative that climate policies have a negative economic impact."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The remainder of the fund will go toward implementing \"zero energy\" building codes, which will require residential buildings to install small-scale renewable energy generators \"to achieve zero-net carbon.\"",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the policy as a mandate that forces homeowners to spend money on specific renewable energy installations, implying the policies are designed to create a market and generate profit for the renewable energy industry rather than addressing genuine environmental needs."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes climate policies by framing them as a national security liability that weakens America, which is a critique of the policies that does not fit the more specific subnarratives about economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "This direct statement from the text explicitly criticizes the policies of the national government (the Biden administration) for causing negative economic consequences, specifically unaffordable housing."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that \"lower greenhouse gas emissions\" and fight the so-called \"climate crisis.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes a specific government institution (the Department of Energy) and its program, framing its actions (incentivizing new building codes) as part of a questionable agenda (fighting the \"so-called 'climate crisis'\"). This supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives like 'Criticism of national governments' (which is already covered) or the others listed, as it targets a specific agency's policy implementation."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "fight the so-called \"climate crisis.\"",
      "reasoning": "The use of scare quotes around 'climate crisis' directly dismisses and minimizes the severity of climate change, which is a core tactic of the 'Downplaying climate change' narrative. This does not fit a more specific subcategory like natural cycles or human impact, so it is classified as 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the consequences of green policies (high prices, economic strain) as a factor that weakens America's geopolitical and military strength against adversaries, supporting the parent narrative that green policies serve as a geopolitical instrument by undermining national power."

      "evidence_quote": "These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are incapable of meeting the energy demands of the nation or world, which is the core definition of unreliability for widespread adoption."

      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly labels wind, solar, and biomass as 'inefficient and expensive,' directly supporting the subnarrative that renewable energy is too costly."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The remainder of the fund will go toward implementing \"zero energy\" building codes, which will require residential buildings to install small-scale renewable energy generators \"to achieve zero-net carbon.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by framing green technology mandates (renewable energy generators on homes) as a costly and burdensome policy imposition, which is a controversy about the technology's implementation but does not fit the specific definitions of dangerous, unreliable, costly, or nuclear-related."

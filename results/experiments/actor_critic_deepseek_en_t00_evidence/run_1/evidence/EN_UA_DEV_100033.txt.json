      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "According to top Kremlin propagandists, it’s only a matter of time before the West admits its defeat and pays reparations to Moscow or risks a devastating nuclear strike.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear by presenting a stark choice between submission to Russian demands or facing a nuclear strike, which is a classic fear-amplification tactic."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian state media and government officials have taken to describing any opponents of the Kremlin in Ukraine as or “Banderites,” the followers of Stepan Bandera, the ultranationalist political figure... This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The text describes the systematic use of the derogatory label 'Banderites' (and by extension 'Nazis') to smear and delegitimize Ukrainian opposition, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Ukraine and its people."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "“Right now, President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin’s third proposal to the Ukrainian leadership is on the table. This, of course, is a demonstration of his greatest respect and—I would even say—of love by our President towards the Ukrainian people.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote, from a state TV pundit, explicitly praises Putin's actions as stemming from 'respect' and 'love,' which is a direct positive evaluation of Russia's leadership and its intentions."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "“There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes and undermines the United States by portraying it as gullible and easily controlled, which fits the narrative of discrediting Western nations."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "“Here’s what will be on the table after our victory... The dissolution of NATO... Extradition of all war criminals... like Zelensky... We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself... The return of all Russian properties... Are you including Alaska and Fort Ross?”",
      "reasoning": "This series of quotes outlines a list of extreme demands and predicted negative consequences for the West, including the dissolution of NATO, reparations, and territorial concessions, following a presumed Russian victory."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "“Here’s what will be on the table after our victory... After Ukraine’s demilitarization is completed... we’re going to raise the stakes... For example, the lifting of all sanctions... The dissolution of NATO... Extradition of all war criminals... We should be thinking about reparations...”",
      "reasoning": "The pundit is making detailed predictions and assumptions about the potential results and consequences of the conflict, specifically outlining the terms of a Russian victory."

Tactical or strategic, take a pick. You took our money, you’re the thieves, our talk is short with you: a bullet to the head.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote is a direct and explicit threat of nuclear violence and execution against those who imposed sanctions, designed to evoke fear and anxiety about severe retaliation."

Tactical or strategic, take a pick. You took our money, you’re the thieves, our talk is short with you: a bullet to the head.”",
      "reasoning": "The host Vladimir Soloviev explicitly threatens the use of tactical or strategic nuclear weapons ('what you know we’ve got') as a consequence for not meeting Russian demands, directly evoking fear about the employment of nuclear weapons."

      "evidence_quote": "On Friday, Skabeeva claimed: “Jennifer Psaki’s statement said that no matter what Putin does in Ukraine—whether he uses biological weapons or drops a nuclear bomb—the United States won’t get involved.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by presenting a scenario where Russia could use weapons of mass destruction (biological or nuclear) with impunity, as the U.S. will not intervene. It supports the parent narrative of amplifying fear but does not fit the specific definitions of WWIII, attacking other countries, NATO intervention, or solely nuclear employment (as it combines biological and nuclear)."

      "evidence_quote": "“To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.” Russian state media and government officials have taken to describing any opponents of the Kremlin in Ukraine as or “Banderites,” the followers of Stepan Bandera, the ultranationalist political figure who fought for Ukrainian independence before being assassinated by the KGB in 1959. This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly labels Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites,' a term directly associated with ultranationalist and Nazi-collaborationist history, thereby linking Ukraine to nazism."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "In recent days, Russian state television regressed from Orwellian lies to Kafkaesque nightmares, as pundits started to promote the idea of executing Ukrainians resisting Putin’s war of aggression by hanging. They noted that the so-called “constitution” of the rogue “republics” created in Ukraine by Russian forces conveniently allows for the death penalty.",
      "reasoning": "Promoting the execution of resisters and discussing the legal framework for it within Russian-controlled territories portrays Ukrainian resistance as futile and doomed, implying there is no viable positive future for those who oppose Russia."

      "reasoning": "This distorted statement is used to discredit Ukraine by portraying it as abandoned by its Western allies, undermining its international support and legitimacy, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit a more specific subcategory."

      "evidence_quote": "“Right now, President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin’s third proposal to the Ukrainian leadership is on the table. This, of course, is a demonstration of his greatest respect and—I would even say—of love by our President towards the Ukrainian people.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly praises Putin's character and leadership, framing his negotiation attempts as acts of 'love' and 'respect' for the Ukrainian people, which aligns with presenting his personal qualities positively."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity",
      "evidence_quote": "“Here’s what will be on the table after our victory... After Ukraine’s demilitarization is completed... we’re going to raise the stakes... For example, the lifting of all sanctions... The dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way... We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that too costs money and we should get it back.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote outlines a post-victory vision where Russia, by imposing its terms (demilitarization, dissolution of NATO, reparations), is portrayed as the entity that will restore order and economic compensation, implying it will guarantee peace and prosperity for itself."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by praising Russia's perceived geopolitical superiority and cunning in contrast to a manipulable America, but it does not fit any of the more specific 'Praise of Russia' subnarrative definitions provided."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Multiple state TV shows emphasized the reluctance on the part of the United States and NATO to intervene against Russia’s bloody invasion of its neighbor, presenting it as the proof that the Kremlin can go to any lengths to emerge victorious.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly states that state TV presents Western reluctance to intervene as proof of Kremlin strength, framing the West as weak and unwilling to act, which directly supports the subnarrative definition of presenting the West as non-potent."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "On Monday, disregarding strong bipartisan support of Ukraine in the United States, Skabeeva claimed that Americans don’t care about Ukraine and are concerned only with rising gas prices. She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that the American public is indifferent to Ukraine and only cares about domestic issues like gas prices, supporting the subnarrative that the West is only interested in its own benefits, not Ukraine's fate."

      "evidence_quote": "Matveychev noted: “There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits the West (specifically the U.S.) by portraying it as gullible and easily controlled. It supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West but does not fit neatly into any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, etc.)."

The dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way. Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko... Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko. Extradition of various oligarchs, like [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote outlines a list of demands and concessions the Kremlin expects from the West after victory, including the dissolution of NATO and the extradition of individuals. This supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West by presenting a scenario where the West is forced to make humiliating and damaging concessions, but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that too costs money and we should get it back. The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly demands financial reparations from the West for sanctions and war damage, and the return of seized properties. This directly supports the narrative of negative consequences for the West by portraying a future where the West suffers significant financial and material losses, but it is not covered by the more specific subnarratives."

Tactical or strategic, take a pick. You took our money, you’re the thieves, our talk is short with you: a bullet to the head.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote threatens nuclear strikes against the West if frozen assets are not returned. This supports the parent narrative by presenting an extreme negative consequence (nuclear war) for Western actions, which is not captured by the specific subnarratives about sanctions or refugees."

      "evidence_quote": "In the surreal world of Russian state television, Russia is about to prevail in its war against Ukraine... They insist that everything is going exactly as planned.",
      "reasoning": "The text describes Kremlin propagandists presenting Russia as being on the verge of victory, which inherently implies the opposing Ukrainian military is failing or collapsing, as victory for one side suggests defeat for the other."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "According to top Kremlin propagandists, it’s only a matter of time before the West admits its defeat and pays reparations to Moscow or risks a devastating nuclear strike.",
      "reasoning": "This quote presents a speculative outcome of the conflict where the West is defeated and forced to pay reparations, which supports the parent narrative of speculating on war outcomes but does not fit the specific definitions about army collapse or loss of territory."

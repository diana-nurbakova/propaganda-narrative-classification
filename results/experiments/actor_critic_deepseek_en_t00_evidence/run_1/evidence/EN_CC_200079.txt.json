      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Citing a new study, Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) is urging governments to clamp down on people who wash their jeans and pants more than once per month, and their sweaters more than once per fortnight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific climate policy proposal (restrictions on laundry frequency) promoted by the WEF, questioning its rationale and framing it as a governmental overreach, which aligns with the narrative's definition of questioning the effectiveness and motives behind climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the World Economic Forum, accusing it of hypocrisy and of designing policies that target ordinary citizens while protecting elites, fitting the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities in relation to climate change."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "According to the WEF, the global fashion industry is estimated to generate 92 million tonnes of textile waste each year, and the public must reduce amount by wearing dirty clothes instead of washing them after use.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly links a proposed climate policy (wearing clothes longer, washing less to reduce waste) to a negative economic impact on the fashion industry, as reducing textile waste implies reduced production and sales."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote contrasts the proposed restrictive policies for the public with the lavish, high-carbon lifestyles of elites, implying the policies are not driven by genuine environmental concern but serve to protect the privileges and profits of a powerful class."

      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes climate policies as being unfairly targeted and punitive towards ordinary citizens while protecting elites, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes, including underwear and gym clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the World Economic Forum, an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines to the public, fitting the definition of criticizing the role and influence of international entities on climate policy."

      "reasoning": "This statement discredits a specific class of political figures ('neoliberal politicians') and the political context of the Davos conference by highlighting their hypocrisy in advocating for public sacrifice while engaging in high-carbon personal travel."

It criticizes the WEF's alleged motives and priorities in a general way that is not covered by 'Criticism of international entities' or 'Criticism of political organizations and figures' as defined."

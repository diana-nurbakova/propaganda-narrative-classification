      "evidence_quote": "The group’s assertion that in the U.S. most weather-related deaths “are caused by heat” does not stand up to scrutiny, however, since the majority of weather-related deaths come from cold, not heat.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges and minimizes the significance of a claimed impact of climate change (heat-related deaths), arguing the opposite is true, which fits the definition of downplaying climate change."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "According to data published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), over the past twenty years annual heat-related deaths in the U.S. have ranged between 0.9 and 3.6 per million people whereas cold-related deaths have ranged between 3.6 and 5.9 per million people.",
      "reasoning": "The text uses specific data to counter the scientific claim about heat being the leading cause of weather-related deaths, thereby raising doubts about the scientific assertions made by climate advocates."

      "evidence_quote": "According to the Lancet, people around the world are 9.4 times more likely to die from the cold than from the heat. It added that over the past 20 years, the death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that the net mortality impact of temperature change is minimal or even beneficial, as the decrease in cold deaths outweighs the increase in heat deaths. This downplays the significance of the temperature increase's impact, claiming its overall effect is not severe."

      "reasoning": "The text directly challenges the methodology or metric (the claim about leading cause of weather-related deaths) used by the cited source (Science Alert), labeling it as not standing up to scrutiny and presenting counter-data to assert it is faulty."

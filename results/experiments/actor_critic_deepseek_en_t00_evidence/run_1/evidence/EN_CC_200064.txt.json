      "reasoning": "This direct quote from the activist group emphasizes catastrophic, world-ending consequences of climate change, which aligns with the narrative of amplifying fears about climate impacts."

      "evidence_quote": "Watch: Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane After Storming Swedish Dance Show",

      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage... The three activists jumped onto the stage, stood in front of the studio camera, released yellow paint powder, and unfurled a large banner... The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "The text repeatedly frames the activists' actions as disruptive, illegal ('vandalism'), and dangerous (noting a pregnant dancer was present), which constitutes a criticism of the climate movement's tactics. This criticism supports the parent narrative but does not align with the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or being solely an 'ad hominem attack'."

      "reasoning": "The quote, attributed to the activist group, presents a catastrophic, large-scale scenario of global collapse as a direct result of climate change, fitting the definition of a doomsday scenario for humans."

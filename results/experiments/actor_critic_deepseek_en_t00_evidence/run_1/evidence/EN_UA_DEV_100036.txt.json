      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments. This perception presents a significant challenge in encouraging people to seek necessary mental health treatment.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights a systemic failure and negative perception of Ukraine's own healthcare infrastructure, specifically its mental health services, framing them as oppressive and ineffective, which undermines the legitimacy and capability of Ukrainian institutions."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The full-scale invasion has magnified Ukraine's pre-existing challenges and introduced larger societal issues... Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",
      "reasoning": "This statement emphasizes the profound, ongoing, and seemingly endless psychological trauma inflicted by the war, evoking fear and anxiety about the future and the lasting societal damage, which aligns with amplifying fears related to the conflict's consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly portrays a bleak, indefinite future for Ukraine, emphasizing a psychological state of hopelessness where planning is futile because the war has no visible conclusion."

      "evidence_quote": "The full-scale invasion has magnified Ukraine's pre-existing challenges and introduced larger societal issues. The collective impact of population displacement, healthcare infrastructure destruction, and economic hardships contributes significantly to the deteriorating mental health of the society.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by cataloging a series of severe, compounding crises (displacement, destroyed healthcare, economic ruin) that collectively paint a picture of a society in a state of profound, systemic collapse and deterioration, which does not fit a more specific subnarrative definition."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The impact of the war extends beyond physical damage, as it profoundly traumatizes Ukrainian society and threatens to affect future generations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly supports the parent narrative by amplifying fears about the war's devastating and long-lasting human cost, specifically the profound societal trauma and its intergenerational impact, which does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions."

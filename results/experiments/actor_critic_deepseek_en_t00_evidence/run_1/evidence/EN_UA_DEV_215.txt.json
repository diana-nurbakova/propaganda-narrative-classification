      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly attacks the character and legitimacy of the Ukrainian state by asserting widespread, pre-existing corruption, which aligns with the narrative of undermining Ukraine's societal and governmental integrity."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the motives of Western (specifically American) aid, portraying it as cynical and self-interested rather than genuinely humanitarian or supportive, which fits the narrative of discrediting Western actions and diplomacy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This statement introduces a respected journalist's claims while immediately framing them as 'thinly sourced' and accused of being propaganda, which serves to cast doubt on media narratives and sources regarding the war, aligning with the distrust towards media narrative."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian nation and society",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded.",
      "reasoning": "This direct statement characterizes Ukrainian society as fundamentally and historically corrupt, attacking the legitimacy and reputability of the Ukrainian people and nation as a whole."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities",
      "evidence_quote": "War is a business, and the business of war is going on in Ukraine. The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames Ukraine as a location where massive fraud and the diversion of weapons to 'the wrong hands' (implying criminal or terrorist elements) is a major concern, portraying the country as a center for illicit activities related to war profiteering."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly links revelations of corruption and fraud to a delegitimization of President Zelensky, portraying the Ukrainian government and its leadership as corrupt and eroding international trust."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Does learning that this isn’t the Disney version of war and that the side the West is fighting for is simply the lesser corrupt among the two parties mean we should soften support for Ukraine’s war effort?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames Ukraine not as a righteous victim but as 'the lesser corrupt' party in a conflict between two corrupt entities. This supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about the government, military, or society, but a generalized moral discrediting of the Ukrainian side in the conflict)."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly states that revelations of corruption may cause the American public to soften its stance and be less willing to financially support Ukraine, which aligns with the subnarrative's definition of Western fatigue or disinterest in supporting Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly claims that Western (specifically American) support for Ukraine is driven solely by self-interest (protecting Europe/NATO from Russia) and not by concern for Ukrainians, matching the subnarrative definition."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames a prominent Western journalist (and by extension, the institution he represents) as a conduit for Russian propaganda, discrediting Western media by suggesting it is an instrument for disseminating manipulative information."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This thinly sourced statement, however, skims over the complexities of a very nuanced war. It is not a statement that can exist without a deeper explanation–and that explanation takes the wind out of the sails of a very damaging allegation.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a specific media claim (from Hersh) as being 'thinly sourced' and lacking necessary context, thereby fostering a general distrust towards media reporting on the war. It supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media but does not fit the specific definitions of discrediting Western or Ukrainian media as institutions; it targets the quality and reliability of a specific report."

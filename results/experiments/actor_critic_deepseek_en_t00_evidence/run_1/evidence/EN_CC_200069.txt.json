      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The quote describes direct action against specific climate-related policies (street zone sectioning barriers), questioning their legitimacy and effectiveness by advocating for their destruction."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The act of residents 'taking matters into their own hands' to destroy barriers installed by local authorities constitutes a direct challenge to the competence and authority of the governing bodies that implemented the policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames the climate movement and its concerns as irrational or extreme, directly challenging its motives and impact."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Taking matters into their own hands, Oxford residents are destroying street zoning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shows opposition to a specific climate policy (street zoning barriers), supporting the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies. The action of destroying barriers constitutes a clear criticism, but the text does not specify the reason for opposition (e.g., ineffectiveness, economic harm), so it fits the 'Other' category."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' frames climate action as a deceitful scheme, implying criticism of the authorities and institutions promoting it. This supports the parent narrative but does not specify a level of government or entity, so it fits the 'Other' category."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' directly characterizes the climate movement's stance as exaggerated, hysterical, or irrational, fitting the definition of alarmism."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' frames the climate movement as a deceitful confidence trick or scam. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks' as it is a more general accusation of deception."

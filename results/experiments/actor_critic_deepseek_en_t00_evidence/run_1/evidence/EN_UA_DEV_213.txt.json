      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes the responsibility for escalating towards war to the US and its allies, shifting blame away from Russia, the actual invader."

      "evidence_quote": "In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.",
      "reasoning": "This statement undermines the legitimacy of the Ukrainian government by claiming it originated from a foreign-backed coup, directly attacking its political foundation."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.",
      "reasoning": "This portrays Russia as being victimized by external powers seeking to strip it of its sovereignty, evoking sympathy for Russia's position as being unfairly targeted."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This directly criticizes Western media and, by extension, Western information integrity, accusing them of lying and running disinformation campaigns, which discredits Western diplomatic and informational efforts."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly questions the reliability and integrity of Western media, labeling it 'filthy pro-imperialist' and the source of war talk, undermining public confidence in these sources."

      "reasoning": "This evokes fear and anxiety by framing the current situation as a looming 'catastrophe' comparable to World War II, amplifying severe concerns about the conflict's consequences."

      "reasoning": "This quote shifts the responsibility for aggressive action (a false-flag operation) to Ukraine, portraying it as the party planning an attack, which aligns with portraying Ukraine as the aggressor."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.",
      "reasoning": "This statement blames the current conflict on the historical dissolution of the USSR and the misguided policies of its former leadership, which is a form of blaming the war on others (historical actors/ideologies) that does not fit the specific 'West' or 'Ukraine' subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Ukraine as a mere tool or 'pretext' for Western aggression, which discredits Ukraine's agency and role in the conflict. This theme of Ukraine being used does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Russia's posture and potential actions as a necessary and defensive response to NATO's expansion and aggressive intentions, justifying them as self-defence rather than unprovoked aggression."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash. Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions. The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly presents the United States (and by extension the West) as a non-potent entity by detailing its severe domestic crises—unsustainable debt, staggering inequality, a dysfunctional political system, and social tensions at a breaking point. This portrayal of profound internal weakness supports the subnarrative that 'The West is weak.'"

      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly claims that the West is using Ukraine as a 'pretext' for its own confrontation with Russia, implying that their actions are not driven by genuine concern for Ukraine's fate but by their own strategic interests."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted. It writes: 'With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.'",
      "reasoning": "The text quotes and endorses the view that the 'window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open,' directly discrediting the potential of ongoing or potential diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict."

Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West by accusing its leading media institutions of running a 'disinformation campaign' with 'transparent lies,' which is a form of discrediting Western institutions and their credibility. This specific argument—that Western media is deliberately lying to the public—does not fit neatly into any of the other provided subnarrative definitions."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by broadly labeling media across the Atlantic as 'filthy pro-imperialist,' but it does not fit the specific definition of 'Western media is an instrument of propaganda' (which is more about their role as a propaganda instrument) or 'Ukrainian media cannot be trusted' (which is not mentioned). It is a distinct, general expression of media distrust."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly evokes fear of an impending war, which is the core of the parent narrative. However, it does not specify the risk of WWIII, an attack on other countries, nuclear weapons, or NATO intervention, so it does not fit the more specific definitions."

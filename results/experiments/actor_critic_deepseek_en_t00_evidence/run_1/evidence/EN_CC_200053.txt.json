      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Sunak has been sending mixed signals about his government’s energy and climate policies. The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly reports on policy reversals (fracking moratorium) and the demotion of key climate ministers, framing the government's approach as inconsistent and sending 'mixed signals.' This factual reporting implicitly questions the effectiveness, stability, and commitment behind the UK's climate policies, aligning with the narrative's definition of questioning effectiveness and impact."

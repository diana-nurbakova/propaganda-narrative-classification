      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "This opening statement directly questions the effectiveness and catastrophic consequences of the policy goal advocated by climate protesters, framing it as genocidal and therefore criticizing its viability and impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intellectual foundation of the climate movement (specifically 'Just Stop Oil' members) by attributing their position to being misled by 'propaganda' rather than sound reasoning or science."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote minimizes the significance of human-caused climate change by arguing that natural sources emit far more greenhouse gases than human activities, thereby downplaying the human impact on the climate."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, presented as a related fact, raises doubts about the scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, directly questioning the science behind a core climate policy recommendation."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "This statement vividly details an apocalyptic, catastrophic scenario resulting from stopping oil use, explicitly emphasizing and amplifying fears about the consequences of implementing such climate policies."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "On the very first day of an oil- and gas-free world as the members of Just Stop Oil envision it, all homes, businesses, and other structures that rely on either or both of these for light, heat, fuel, or what have you would no longer function.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that implementing the policy (stopping oil and gas) would have a catastrophic negative impact on society and the economy by causing homes and businesses to cease functioning, which aligns with the subnarrative's definition of negative economic/societal outcomes."

      "evidence_quote": "The theory that climate fanatics have adopted as to why this is all happening blames human activity and industry, even though the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the foundational premise of climate policies (that human emissions are the primary driver) is flawed because natural sources emit more. This directly suggests that policies aimed at reducing human emissions would fail to achieve their intended environmental goal of stopping climate change, as they are targeting the wrong source."

      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The text uses scare quotes around terms like 'global warming' and 'boiling oceans', framing the movement's concerns as exaggerated fears rather than scientific realities, which aligns with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda. As the end of the biblical age of grace approaches, the world is increasingly coming unhinged, including environmentally as the birth pangs intensify. The theory that climate fanatics have adopted as to why this is all happening blames human activity and industry... Even so, member of groups like Just Stop Oil have been deluded – or perhaps deluded themselves – into believing that they must appease the climate gods...",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the climate movement by attributing its beliefs to religious-like delusion, propaganda, and a flawed theory, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks on key activists'."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that natural sources (volcanoes) emit far more greenhouse gases than human activities, supporting the subnarrative that human activities do not impact climate change."

      "reasoning": "This statement dismisses the core premise of man-made climate change ('melting or boiling') and directs readers to a source claiming it is false. It supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."
    },

      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the premise that human CO2 emissions are the primary driver of climate change by asserting that natural sources (volcanoes) emit far more, thereby downplaying the significance of the human-caused greenhouse effect."

      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, presented as a factual report, cites a COP28 president to claim there is 'no science' supporting a key climate policy, thereby discrediting the scientific consensus and the reliability of the scientific community on this issue."

      "evidence_quote": "The theory that climate fanatics have adopted as to why this is all happening blames human activity and industry...",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the scientific theory of anthropogenic climate change as a belief held by 'fanatics,' which supports the parent narrative of questioning climate science by casting doubt on its foundational premise, but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly presents an intense catastrophic scenario where billions of people die as a result of implementing the climate policy demanded by protesters, fitting the definition of a doomsday scenario for humans."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "This statement references and amplifies existing fears (global warming, boiling oceans) to characterize the climate movement's motivations, supporting the parent narrative. It does not fit the specific definitions of 'Earth will be uninhabitable soon' (no timeline), 'Doomsday scenarios' (it's a stated fear, not a predicted scenario), or 'Whatever we do it is already too late' (it's about policy goals)."

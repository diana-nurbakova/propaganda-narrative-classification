      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the banks' climate-related actions (cutting fossil fuel investments) as a direct response to pressure from activist investors, questioning the voluntary or purely scientific basis of the policies and suggesting they are driven by external activist pressure."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks — all named above — submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shows a major financial regulatory authority (the Federal Reserve) mandating climate-related disclosures from banks. This frames environmental policy as being enforced through financial regulation and institutional power, aligning with the narrative that green policies are tools wielded by powerful institutions."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Deutsche bank in particular drew some criticism from activist groups that considered the move to be insufficient, since it did not include similar cutbacks in oil and gas",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes climate activist groups for deeming a bank's significant action (cutting coal financing) as 'insufficient,' challenging the motives and demands of the climate movement as being perpetually unsatisfied or unreasonable."

      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes climate policies by framing them as being driven by external activist pressure on banks, rather than being independently formulated or economically rational. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the more specific definitions about ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios... New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote describes how activist pressure and the threat of financial penalties (pulling pension funds) are being used to force major U.S. banks to adopt specific climate policies. This supports the parent narrative that green policies are being used as instruments to exert influence and control, though it does not fit the more specific definitions of 'abusive international relations' or 'neo-colonialism'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Deutsche bank in particular drew some criticism from activist groups that considered the move to be insufficient, since it did not include similar cutbacks in oil and gas",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays climate activist groups as making extreme, never-satisfied demands. Even after a bank announces a significant policy to reduce coal financing, activists criticize it as 'insufficient' for not going further, which aligns with the subnarrative that the movement exaggerates demands or severity (alarmism) by moving goalposts."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by criticizing the climate movement's tactics (applying pressure on banks), but it does not fit the definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'. It is a distinct criticism of the movement's methods and influence, thus it is classified as 'Other'."

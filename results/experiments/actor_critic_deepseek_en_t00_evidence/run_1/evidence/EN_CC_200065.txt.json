      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly minimizes the significance of the reported record temperatures by arguing the instrumental record is too short to support such long-term claims, which is a core tactic of downplaying climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote raises specific doubts about the scientific methods (paleoclimate proxy data) used to make long-term climate claims, directly aligning with the narrative of questioning the science and measurements."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely “the hottest day in thousands of years.”",
      "reasoning": "The term 'climate alarmists' is a pejorative label that challenges the motives and integrity of those raising climate concerns, framing their actions as 'lamenting' rather than reporting, which fits the definition of criticizing the climate movement."

      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly downplays the significance of claims about long-term temperature records by arguing that the instrumental data record is too short to support such conclusions, which is a general argument against the severity of climate change not captured by a more specific subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote is used to cast doubt on the reliability of paleoclimate data (proxy records) used to make long-term historical comparisons, directly questioning the scientific methodologies underpinning claims about past temperatures."

      "reasoning": "The author labels the claims of climate scientists and reporters as 'extravagant' and frames the entire piece with the term 'Climate alarmists,' which directly characterizes the climate movement as being excessively alarmist."

      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This sarcastic rhetorical question implies that the climate movement is motivated by narrative and sensationalism rather than scientific evidence, which is a criticism of the movement's motives not covered by the 'alarmist' subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the reliability of the paleoclimate data (proxy records) used to make long-term claims, arguing they are fundamentally different and not comparable to direct measurements, which aligns with the definition of criticizing methodologies as unreliable."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by questioning the validity of claims about temperatures over thousands or 100,000 years, based on the limited timeframe of direct data collection. It does not fit a more specific subnarrative, as it is not about flawed methodologies, lack of temperature increase, greenhouse effect, or the scientific community's reliability, but rather a general challenge to the temporal scope of the claims."

It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit the specific definitions for 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto Western nations (the UK and US), framing them as the actors who prevented a peaceful settlement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained... the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers... the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "These statements collectively undermine Ukraine's military effectiveness and strategic position, portraying its government as struggling with conscription and its military as ineffective and depleted."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This criticizes Western (and Ukrainian) policy as reckless and counterproductive, suggesting they are choosing pointless escalation over rational diplomacy to end the conflict."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This statement evokes fear by predicting that current Western/Ukrainian policies are leading the world toward a potential nuclear catastrophe, a classic fear-amplifying narrative."

      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the continuation of the war from Russia (the invader) to Western nations (the UK and US), portraying them as the actors who chose to prolong the conflict by convincing Ukraine to reject a peace deal."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by attributing the escalation and prolongation of the conflict to the Ukrainian government and its Western backers, rather than to Russia's initial and ongoing invasion. It is a distinct argument not captured by the specific 'The West are the aggressors' subnarrative, which focused on the initial rejection of a deal."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained. Recently, the Russians even launched a brand new incursion into territory around the northeastern city of Kharkiv—territory that had already been recaptured by the Ukrainians in late 2022.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the effectiveness and capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces by highlighting their failure to hold gains and their net loss of territory, which aligns with the definition of discrediting the military."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv... But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This statement portrays Ukraine as having no viable military path to victory or even to hold its current positions, depicting a future with no positive potential, which matches the 'situation is hopeless' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What makes Ukraine’s situation even more tragic is how easily it could have been avoided... officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by portraying its government as foolish or easily manipulated by Western powers, leading to unnecessary tragedy. This does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives like 'puppet of the West' (which implies control, not just poor advice) or 'discrediting government' (which is more about corruption/incompetence rather than this specific historical decision)."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that Western powers (UK and US) persuaded Ukraine to reject a peace deal that would have ended the war, prioritizing a continued fight over Ukraine's immediate interests of peace and territorial control, thus supporting the subnarrative that the West acts for its own geopolitical interests, not Ukraine's welfare."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Western/NATO strategy as unrealistic and dangerous, advocating for diplomacy. It supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomatic/military posture but does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it is not about division, weakness, overreaction, fatigue, or the impossibility of diplomacy)."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII",
      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia...",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes the fear of a large-scale, world war-level conflict by referencing a 'World War II–level offensive,' which aligns with the subnarrative's definition of warning against upsetting Russia and evoking fear of causing WW3."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear and anxiety about a 'catastrophic nuclear accident,' which directly supports the subnarrative about the fear of nuclear weapons being employed."

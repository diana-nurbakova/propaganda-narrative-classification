      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Green Madness: Leftist Scottish Govt Cut Down 16 Million Trees to Put up Wind Farms",
      "reasoning": "The title directly criticizes a specific climate policy (wind farm development) by labeling it 'Green Madness' and highlighting a perceived negative consequence (cutting down trees), questioning the policy's effectiveness and environmental impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the reliance on green technology (wind turbines) as creating a dependency on a geopolitical adversary (Communist China), suggesting the policy serves or strengthens a rival power rather than being purely for environmental benefit."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals...",
      "reasoning": "This statement aggregates multiple criticisms (deforestation, wildlife harm, resource dependency) to express skepticism and highlight controversies surrounding the implementation and consequences of wind turbine technology."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a climate policy (promoting wind farms) by highlighting a specific negative consequence (deforestation) that is not captured by the more specific subnarratives about economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "“I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly states that rural communities have concerns about 'damage to business' caused by wind farm developments, which directly supports the claim that climate policies have negative economic outcomes."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly states a dependency on a specific foreign nation (China) for the materials essential to the green energy policy, framing the policy within a geopolitical context of reliance on a geopolitical rival."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly presents a controversy about wind turbines (a green technology) by highlighting the significant environmental cost of deforestation required for their installation, which contradicts their 'green' label."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement introduces another controversy by linking wind turbines to the harmful mining of rare earth minerals, framing the technology as having negative, indirect consequences that are part of a contentious debate."

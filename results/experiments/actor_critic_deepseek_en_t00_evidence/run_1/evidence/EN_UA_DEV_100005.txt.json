      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by labeling Western media as 'corporation propaganda' and claiming it withholds information, but it does not fit the specific definitions of 'instrument of propaganda' or 'Ukrainian media cannot be trusted'. It is a distinct, leftover piece of evidence."

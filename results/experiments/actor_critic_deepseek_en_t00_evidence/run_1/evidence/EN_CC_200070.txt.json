      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined a 'global coalition of mayors' at a summit on climate change this week in Buenos Aires, Argentina, burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the actions of a prominent figure within the climate movement (Mayor Garcetti, a former C40 Chair) for hypocrisy, highlighting the contradiction between advocating for climate action and taking a high-emission flight. This challenges the integrity and impact of the movement's actors."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "White Garcetti was away, Los Angeles continued to struggle with the high crime and homelessness that have come to define his legacy, as well as a crisis in the City Council triggered by racist comments from City Council members within Garcetti’s party.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the competence and legacy of Mayor Garcetti and his administration, highlighting failures in governance (crime, homelessness, political crisis) while he was attending an international summit, thereby challenging his priorities and effectiveness as an authority."

      "evidence_quote": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined a “global coalition of mayors” at a summit on climate change this week in Buenos Aires, Argentina, burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights hypocrisy by suggesting the mayor's actions (flying to a climate summit) contradict the movement's stated goals, implying the movement is not sincere and is engaged in unethical or self-serving practices."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by arguing that its activities (like the summit) distract from or are prioritized over more immediate, serious local problems, which is a form of criticism not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "White Garcetti was away, Los Angeles continued to struggle with the high crime and homelessness that have come to define his legacy, as well as a crisis in the City Council triggered by racist comments from City Council members within Garcetti’s party.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Mayor Eric Garcetti's performance and legacy, focusing on domestic failures (crime, homelessness) and a political crisis within his party, thereby discrediting him as a political figure in the context of his climate-focused trip."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses disapproval of the decision-making and approach of the summit organizers (an institutional body) for holding an in-person event requiring travel, which contradicts the stated goal of combating climate change. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit the specific definitions targeting the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures."

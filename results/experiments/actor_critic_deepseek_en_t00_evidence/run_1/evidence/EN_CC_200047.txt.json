      "evidence_quote": "According to a report from the Committee to Unleash Prosperity (CUP), America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the motives and impact of specific climate policies (rationing of essentials) by framing them as a 'plan' imposed on the public, which aligns with criticizing the effectiveness and societal impact of such policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The quote challenges the integrity and intentions of both the 'American elites' and the World Economic Forum by labeling their policies as 'tyrannical' and placing 'climate' in scare quotes, indicating a lack of trust in these authorities."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Reporting on the story, The College Fix writes that the “Committee to Unleash Prosperity [CUP], in a survey that sought to measure the beliefs of ‘elites,’ stated the findings reveal climate change ‘is clearly an obsession of the very rich and highly educated.’”",
      "reasoning": "This verbatim quote from the text, attributed to the CUP report via The College Fix, directly challenges the motives of the climate movement by framing concern for climate change as an 'obsession' of a specific, privileged social class."

      "reasoning": "The text frames the WEF's agenda as a secretive 'plan' supported by a powerful, defined group ('elites') to impose restrictive policies (rationing) on the general public, creating a classic narrative of a hidden agenda by a powerful cabal."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes climate policies by labeling them as 'tyrannical,' which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not align with the specific definitions of being ineffective, economically harmful, or profit-driven."

      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes 'America’s wealthiest citizens' as a political/social elite class, framing them as supporting oppressive policies, which discredits these influential figures in the context of the climate debate."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Astonishingly, the polling shows that almost 90 percent of “American elites” believe strict rationing of gas, meat, and electricity is necessary to combat the so-called “climate crisis.”",
      "reasoning": "The use of the phrase 'so-called “climate crisis”' frames the climate movement's characterization of the issue as an exaggerated or unfounded alarm, directly matching the definition of suggesting the movement exaggerates severity for dramatic effect."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by portraying its policies as 'tyrannical' and driven by a detached elite, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks on key activists.'"

      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The use of the word 'allegedly' in the quote casts doubt on the stated motive of fighting climate change, implying the rationing plan is driven by an ulterior motive, such as exerting control over the public, which aligns with the definition of claiming the climate agenda has hidden motives."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the West's (specifically Washington's) primary motive for involvement in the war as securing access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, shifting the responsibility for the conflict's continuation and nature from the invader (Russia) to the West's aggressive economic interests."

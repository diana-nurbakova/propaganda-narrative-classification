      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock",
      "reasoning": "The quote lists the war, sanctions, and pipeline sabotage as causes of Germany's energy crisis, framing the West's sanctions regime as a primary destructive force alongside the war itself, thereby shifting blame away from Russia's decision to invade Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet... Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly details severe negative economic consequences (high electricity prices, inflation, recession) for Germany and other European nations as a direct result of the disruption of Russian gas supplies, which aligns with the narrative of highlighting adverse outcomes for Western countries."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders?... Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes and discredits the competence and motives of German (and by extension, Western) leadership, portraying their energy and climate policies as foolish and destructive to their own nation."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly blames the economic hardship on the Western sanctions regime, framing it as a primary cause of Germany's energy crisis alongside the war itself, thereby shifting responsibility for the conflict's negative consequences away from Russia and onto the West."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What President Donald Trump was referring to in 2018 was Germany’s increasing dependence on Russian gas, which in turn resulted from “green” energy policies implemented over the previous decade.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, and the article's overall thesis, blames Germany's economic woes on its own 'green fanaticism' and energy policies, which made it dependent on Russia. This supports the parent narrative of blaming the war's consequences on others (in this case, Germany's own political choices and the green movement) rather than on Russia's decision to invade Ukraine."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes Germany's energy crisis and high costs to the Western sanctions regime against Russia, framing the sanctions as a self-inflicted wound that forces Germany into an emergency situation, which matches the definition of catastrophizing the negative effects of Western sanctions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This passage details severe negative economic consequences (high electricity prices, worse inflation) for Germany and other European nations as a direct result of the disruption of Russian gas supplies linked to the conflict and sanctions. It supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West but does not fit the specific 'sanctions backfire' subnarrative (which is about the sanctions themselves backfiring) or the 'refugee flows' subnarrative. It is a distinct argument about economic damage, thus qualifying as 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a division within the EU, specifically between nations heavily reliant on Russian gas (like Germany and Italy) and other European countries, suggesting the bloc is not a unified entity with shared interests or outcomes."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This statement presents a core Western European power, Germany, as economically crippled and failing due to its own policies, which implicitly portrays the West as weakened and self-sabotaging."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock...",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the Western sanctions regime as a direct cause of Germany's energy crisis and economic suffering, implying the West's reaction (sanctions) has been disproportionate and self-destructive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The proposed solution of German leaders has been for its citizens to consume less and its factories to produce less or move manufacturing offshore. But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders?",
      "reasoning": "This frames the suffering of the German people as a consequence of their leaders' policies, which are implicitly linked to supporting Ukraine via sanctions. It suggests the West's (German) actions are not about Ukraine's fate but are ideologically driven and harmful to its own citizens."

      "reasoning": "The text describes the Russian state media's practice of broadly labeling Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites' or 'Nazis,' which is a tactic to undermine the legitimacy and character of Ukrainians resisting the invasion."

'This, of course, is a demonstration of his greatest respect and—I would even say—of love by our President towards the Ukrainian people.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Putin's actions as benevolent and loving, which is a positive, commendatory framing of Russia's leadership and intentions."

      "reasoning": "This question, posed by a prominent state TV host, explicitly and casually references the option of using tactical or strategic nuclear strikes, normalizing the discussion of their employment and amplifying related fears."

      "reasoning": "This statement presents the use of nuclear weapons ('Tactical or strategic') as an explicit, on-the-table threat to coerce Western nations, directly amplifying fears about their potential use."

      "evidence_quote": "“The dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way.”",
      "reasoning": "This demand for NATO's dissolution, framed as a post-victory condition, implies a future Russian threat or action against NATO member states, supporting the subnarrative that Russia will attack other countries."

      "evidence_quote": "“Here’s what will be on the table after our victory... After Ukraine’s demilitarization is completed... we’re going to raise the stakes... For example, the lifting of all sanctions... The dissolution of NATO... Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko... Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko. Extradition of various oligarchs... We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself... The return of all Russian properties... I think we should start voicing all of that, so they understand what will be on the table. You didn’t want to talk to us about something small, like Ukraine’s neutrality, here’s what you get. And that’s not even all of it.”",
      "reasoning": "This extensive list of extreme, humiliating, and expansive demands (dissolution of alliances, reparations, territorial claims, extradition of foreign leaders) presented as post-victory terms serves to amplify war-related fears by depicting a radically aggressive and uncompromising Russian stance that escalates the conflict's stakes far beyond Ukraine."

      "evidence_quote": "She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.” Russian state media and government officials have taken to describing any opponents of the Kremlin in Ukraine as or “Banderites,” the followers of Stepan Bandera, the ultranationalist political figure who fought for Ukrainian independence before being assassinated by the KGB in 1959. This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly labels Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites,' a term used to associate them with historical ultranationalist figures and, by extension, Nazi ideology, which directly matches the definition of discrediting Ukraine by associating it with nazism."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "In the surreal world of Russian state television, Russia is about to prevail in its war against Ukraine, which is being presented as a battle against the United States and NATO.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the conflict not as a war against Ukraine itself, but as a battle against the US and NATO, implying Ukraine is merely a proxy or puppet being used by Western powers, which aligns with the subnarrative definition."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly praises Vladimir Putin's personal qualities, framing his actions as stemming from 'respect' and 'love' for the Ukrainian people, which aligns with the definition of presenting Putin positively and highlighting his leadership qualities."

      "reasoning": "The statement packages Putin's negotiation attempts as an act of goodwill and love, portraying Russia (through its president) as a benevolent actor seeking a peaceful resolution, which fits the narrative of Russia as a guarantor of peace."

      "reasoning": "This quote, while primarily antagonistic towards the US and NATO, implies Russia's strength and strategic position to dictate terms post-victory, suggesting an underlying theme of Russia's power and potential to reshape international order, which aligns with the idea of Russia having leverage and support to challenge existing structures. The broader context of the article shows state TV leveraging clips from international figures (Trump, Tucker Carlson) to suggest dissent or support within other countries."

      "evidence_quote": "“We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that too costs money and we should get it back. The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.” ... “That was my next point. As well as the Antarctic... We discovered it, so it belongs to us... Also, the return of all medals that have been unlawfully taken from our sportsmen during all Olympic games... I think we should start voicing all of that, so they understand what will be on the table.",
      "reasoning": "These statements present a vision of a triumphant, powerful Russia that is entitled to reparations, the return of historical properties (including Alaska and the Antarctic), and the rectification of perceived past injustices. This supports the parent narrative of praising Russia by portraying it as a victorious, rightful claimant to global assets and respect, but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about military might, Putin, peace, or explicit international support)."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Multiple state TV shows emphasized the reluctance on the part of the United States and NATO to intervene against Russia’s bloody invasion of its neighbor, presenting it as the proof that the Kremlin can go to any lengths to emerge victorious.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the West's (U.S. and NATO) reluctance to intervene militarily as proof of weakness, allowing Russia to act with impunity, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as non-potent."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the American public is indifferent to Ukraine's fate, suggesting Western support is not driven by genuine concern for Ukraine but by other, presumably self-serving, interests."

      "evidence_quote": "On Friday, Skabeeva claimed: “Jennifer Psaki’s statement said that no matter what Putin does in Ukraine—whether he uses biological weapons or drops a nuclear bomb—the United States won’t get involved.”",
      "reasoning": "This distorted claim presents Western (U.S.) policy as one of non-intervention even in the face of extreme Russian actions, implicitly arguing that any Western reaction (like sanctions) is therefore an overreaction to a conflict the West won't directly enter."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames Western sanctions as causing damage to Russia, for which Russia will demand financial reparations from the West, implying the sanctions will ultimately cost the West money."

The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States... As well as the Antarctic... We discovered it, so it belongs to us...”",
      "reasoning": "This extensive list of demands (dissolution of NATO, territorial claims, extradition of foreign leaders) goes beyond sanctions backfiring or refugee flows. It presents a catastrophic scenario for the West involving geopolitical dismantling, loss of sovereignty, and humiliation, which supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West."

      "evidence_quote": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to negotiate with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is being packaged as a sign of his love and good will, and not the consequence of mounting losses and humiliating defeats faced by the Russian military in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that the Russian military is facing 'mounting losses and humiliating defeats,' which aligns with the definition of suggesting a significant decline in its effectiveness and strength."

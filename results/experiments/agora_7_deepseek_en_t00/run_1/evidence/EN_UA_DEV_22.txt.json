      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia, the invader, and onto the West, accusing it of vetoing a peace deal."

      "evidence_quote": "\"We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,\"",
      "reasoning": "The statement criticizes Western (European) policy as being a destructive 'proxy war' driven by American interests, which discredits the motives and actions of Western diplomacy."

      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the continuation of the war away from Russia and onto the West, accusing it of blocking a peace agreement and thus preventing the war from ending."

      "evidence_quote": "“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,”",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the conflict as an American proxy war that the EU is fueling, portraying the West (specifically the US and EU) as the aggressors seeking to damage Russia, rather than Russia as the invader."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a “US problem.”",
      "reasoning": "By labeling the conflict a 'US problem', this shifts the origin and primary responsibility for the war onto the United States, aligning with the narrative that the West, not Russia, is the aggressor."

      "evidence_quote": "Members of the European Parliament (EP) engaged in mutual insults during debates on the need for further support to Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the EU as a divided entity, showing internal conflict and inability to present a unified stance on supporting Ukraine, which aligns with the definition of presenting the EU as a set of divided entities and interests."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "“The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies. Don’t expect the citizens of the EU to support you in this; you speak like crazed maniacs.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that Western support for Ukraine is driven by the self-interest of arms manufacturers, not by genuine concern for Ukraine's fate, directly matching the subnarrative definition."

      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote discredits past diplomatic efforts (a peace agreement) by blaming the West for vetoing it, implying that diplomacy was sabotaged and, by extension, that diplomatic solutions are not being pursued in good faith."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "“Don’t expect the citizens of the EU to support you in this; you speak like crazed maniacs.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that EU citizens do not support continued assistance to Ukraine, suggesting public fatigue and disinterest, which aligns with the subnarrative of Western fatigue with supporting Ukraine."

      "evidence_quote": "“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by framing the conflict as a cynical American proxy war that harms European interests and Ukraine itself. This argument does not fit neatly into any of the other specific subnarratives but clearly aims to discredit Western motives and actions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "\"We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly threatens catastrophic retaliation against Western Europe (specifically being 'leveled to the ground') if Western support for Ukraine continues, framing the West's actions as leading to its own destruction."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western support has negative consequences (wasting taxpayer money, fueling destruction), but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows. It is a distinct argument about financial waste and counterproductive outcomes."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a catastrophic escalation, suggesting that continued Western support for Ukraine will provoke a unified Slavic (implied Russian-led) retaliation that would destroy Western Europe, which is a clear warning against upsetting Russia and its sphere, aligning with the fear of causing a wider, potentially world-scale war."

      "evidence_quote": "\"We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by framing the conflict as a destructive, externally-driven 'proxy war' that is against European interests and is actively destroying Ukraine. It evokes fear and anxiety about the consequences of continued involvement, but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about WW3, Russia attacking other countries, nuclear weapons, or NATO intervention."

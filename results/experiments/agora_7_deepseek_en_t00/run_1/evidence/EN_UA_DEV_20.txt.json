      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine. As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "This passage undermines Ukraine's military and governmental effectiveness by highlighting desperate conscription measures, a shortage of soldiers, and an aging fighting force, painting a picture of a failing state."

      "reasoning": "This statement blames the continuation and escalation of the war on Ukraine and its Western allies, framing their actions as the primary cause of prolonged suffering and increased risk, which supports the parent narrative of blaming others but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as cleanly as the primary quote."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by highlighting the failure of a major military operation and net territorial loss."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that Western powers (UK and US) persuaded Ukraine to reject a peace deal, prioritizing a continued conflict that serves Western strategic interests (weakening Russia) over an immediate end to Ukrainian suffering and territorial loss."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames the current Western approach as a fantasy of military victory, implicitly dismissing its viability, and explicitly calls for a shift to diplomacy ('work this conflict out with words'), suggesting that the current path of military support is futile and that diplomatic efforts are being ignored or not seriously pursued."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by directly challenging the Western characterization of Putin's motives as expansionist, instead presenting Russia as a rational actor open to negotiation, thereby undermining the Western rationale for continued military support and portraying Western leadership as dishonest or alarmist."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that prolonging the war is unnecessary and dangerous, but it does so by specifically countering the fear-based premise that Putin is bent on conquering Europe, which is a distinct argument not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

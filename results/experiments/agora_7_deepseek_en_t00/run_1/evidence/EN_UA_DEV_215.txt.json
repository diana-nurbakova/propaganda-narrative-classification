      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly attacks the character and legitimacy of the Ukrainian state by asserting widespread, pre-existing corruption as a universally accepted fact, undermining its moral standing."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the intentions and policies of the West (specifically the U.S.), portraying its aid as cynical and self-interested rather than a genuine diplomatic or humanitarian effort."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly delegitimizes the Ukrainian government and its policies by asserting widespread, pre-existing corruption and implying systemic misuse of foreign aid, portraying the government as fundamentally corrupt."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities",
      "evidence_quote": "War is a business, and the business of war is going on in Ukraine. The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Ukraine as a center for illegal war profiteering, massive fraud, and the potential diversion of weapons, which aligns with the subnarrative of Ukraine being a hub for criminal activities."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by arguing that revelations of corruption are undermining Western (specifically American) public and political support for Ukraine, which is a discrediting effect not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western (specifically American) support for Ukraine is driven by self-interest (protecting Europe/NATO from Russia) rather than genuine concern for Ukraine's people or fate, which matches the definition of the subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote claims that revelations of corruption are causing the American public to become less willing to support Ukraine financially and politically, indicating growing fatigue or disinterest, which aligns with the 'West is tired of Ukraine' subnarrative."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, implying that climate policies mandating such a shift are impractical and could harm energy security and developing nations."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline frames the banks' decisions as a capitulation ('Bend The Knee') to activist pressure, challenging the legitimacy and impact of the climate movement by portraying it as a coercive force rather than a rational driver of policy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Both banks are founding members of the United Nations’ Net Zero Banking Alliance, which requires its 126 members to set goals and disclose financial data related to their efforts to reduce the emissions of their lending portfolio to net zero by 2050.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the role of a UN-led alliance in setting binding requirements for major banks, framing global climate agreements and alliances as instruments that exert centralized control over financial institutions and, by extension, national economies."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF. The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the banks' climate-related actions primarily as financial investment decisions ('investing $0.81... for every $1'), suggesting the shift is driven by profit-seeking in a growing 'green energy' market rather than by genuine environmental concern, aligning with the subnarrative that climate policies are profit-driven."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "(RELATED: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Shatter Record Despite Green Investments)",
      "reasoning": "This parenthetical note, presented as a related fact, directly claims that record emissions are occurring 'Despite Green Investments,' implying that the climate policies and investments being discussed are failing to achieve their intended goal of reducing emissions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline's phrasing 'Bend The Knee To Climate Activists' frames the banks' policy changes as a submission to external pressure from a specific group ('activists'), rather than a rational or independent business decision. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by portraying them as coerced or ideologically driven, which is not captured by the more specific economic or profit-focused subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, by highlighting the financial investment ratio, frames the climate movement's influence on banks as driven by financial interests and market pressures rather than purely environmental concerns, suggesting ulterior motives or a corrupting influence of capital."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios... New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This frames climate activists (specifically 'activist investors' and public officials like Brad Lander) as using coercive financial threats and pressure tactics, attacking their methods and portraying them as aggressive forces compelling banks to act against their business judgment."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline's phrase 'Bend The Knee' frames the banks' actions as a submissive surrender to the demands of climate activists, which is a criticism of the movement's power and influence that does not fit neatly into the 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem' categories. It suggests the movement is overly dominant or coercive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the global push for green energy as potentially exploitative, highlighting how developing nations lack the resources and infrastructure to comply with the rapid shift demanded by international climate alliances and policies, which could place an unfair economic burden on them."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",

      "reasoning": "The statement implies that the transition to renewables, driven by international alliances like the Net Zero Banking Alliance, is a policy imposed by developed nations and financial institutions that developing countries are ill-equipped to adopt, suggesting a form of economic and developmental control reminiscent of colonial practices."

      "reasoning": "This passage depicts green policies as instruments of geopolitical and financial pressure, where activist investors and public officials use financial leverage (threatening to pull pension funds) to enforce climate agendas on major banks, framing environmental goals as tools for exerting control within the global financial system."

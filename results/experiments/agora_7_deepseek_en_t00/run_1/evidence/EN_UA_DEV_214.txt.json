      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes and delegitimizes NATO, portraying it as an outdated and aggressive tool of American foreign policy, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Western institutions and diplomacy."

      "reasoning": "This statement shifts blame for the war's continuation and nature away from Russia (the invader) and onto China and the West, framing the conflict as a Western 'proxy war' and falsely accusing China of being the primary enabler."

      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's war effort and government by portraying its mobilization as a callous and desperate act of sacrificing its own citizens, thus attacking the legitimacy and actions of the Ukrainian state."

      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear of a global, expanding conflict, specifically predicting a 'third world war' as a consequence of American/NATO actions, which is designed to elicit anxiety about severe escalation."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the reliability and truthfulness of Western mainstream media and official narratives, framing them as 'nonsense' and part of a failing 'disinformation war,' thereby undermining trust in these sources."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims the West is willing to prolong the war in Ukraine for its own strategic benefit (expanding to Asia), showing a callous disregard for Ukrainian lives, which are treated as expendable."

      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits Western diplomacy and alliances by portraying NATO not as a legitimate defensive pact but as an aggressive, obsolete tool for American expansion, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit a more specific subnarrative definition."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the war's continuation and escalation onto the West, framing the conflict as a Western 'proxy war' and portraying Western military aid as the primary driver, while dismissing accusations against the actual invader (Russia) and instead blaming the West for scapegoating China."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West for prolonging and expanding the war for its own strategic purposes, and also blames Ukraine ('Kyiv') for its own casualties. This shifts blame away from the invader (Russia) but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as cleanly, as it combines accusations against the West with victim-blaming of Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by portraying NATO as an aggressive, expanding force at Asia's gate, using inflammatory language ('barbarians', 'Trojan horses'). It evokes fear of conflict expansion but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This statement discredits a specific Western media outlet (ABC News) and its interview by framing the US President's claim as a symptom of 'obvious mental decline,' thereby casting doubt on the credibility and seriousness of the media interaction and the narratives it might convey, supporting the broader narrative of distrust towards media."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western military support for Ukraine is depleting their own arsenals ('emptying their own weapons warehouses') and is failing to achieve victory ('still not winning'), which catastrophizes the negative, self-harming effects of Western involvement."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western/American actions are leading to catastrophic global consequences—specifically, the expansion of conflict and the risk of a third world war. This is a negative consequence for the West and the world that does not fit the 'sanctions backfire' or 'refugee flows' definitions."

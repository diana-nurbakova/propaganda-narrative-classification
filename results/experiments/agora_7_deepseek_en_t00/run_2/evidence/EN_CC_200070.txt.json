      "evidence_quote": "burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the mayor's action of flying to a climate summit, framing it as hypocritical and questioning the effectiveness and practical impact of his climate policy commitment by highlighting the carbon cost and opportunity cost of the trip."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "White Garcetti was away, Los Angeles continued to struggle with the high crime and homelessness that have come to define his legacy, as well as a crisis in the City Council triggered by racist comments from City Council members within Garcetti’s party.",
      "reasoning": "This statement challenges the competence and priorities of Mayor Garcetti and his administration, suggesting he is neglecting pressing domestic issues (crime, homelessness, political crisis) in favor of attending an international climate summit, thereby questioning his integrity and effectiveness as a leader."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implicitly criticizes the climate movement and its associated events (the C40 summit) by suggesting its actions are performative or inefficient, as a remote meeting would align better with the goal of reducing emissions, thereby challenging the movement's practical logic and integrity."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific climate policy (the Green New Deal) by highlighting its political opposition and electoral failure, suggesting it is not achieving its intended goals, which aligns with the definition of policies being ineffective."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action – it’s a chance to elevate the solutions cities are deploying at a neighborhood level that have a real impact on people’s daily lives.",
      "reasoning": "The article frames the summit and Garcetti's participation as hypocritical and performative, implying the action is for show or personal/political gain rather than genuine environmental concern, especially when contrasted with the carbon cost of his travel and local problems. The subnarrative about policies being 'only for profit' captures this idea of actions driven by ulterior motives (like political prestige or coalition-building) rather than sincere environmental goals."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate policy actor (the mayor) for personal hypocrisy and poor prioritization (ignoring local crises like crime and homelessness). It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies/actors but does not fit the definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or being profit-driven. It is a distinct argument about hypocrisy and misaligned priorities."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Mayor Eric Garcetti's performance and legacy, focusing on domestic failures (crime, homelessness) and a political crisis within his party, thereby discrediting him as a political figure in the context of his climate-focused trip."

      "reasoning": "This statement implicitly criticizes the decision-making and priorities of the summit organizers (an institutional body) by questioning the necessity of in-person attendance, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit a more specific subcategory like criticism of the EU, international entities, or national governments."

      "evidence_quote": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined a “global coalition of mayors” at a summit on climate change this week in Buenos Aires, Argentina, burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights hypocrisy by suggesting the mayor's actions (flying to a climate summit) contradict the movement's stated goals, implying the movement is not sincere and is engaged in unethical or corrupt practices (like wasteful travel)."

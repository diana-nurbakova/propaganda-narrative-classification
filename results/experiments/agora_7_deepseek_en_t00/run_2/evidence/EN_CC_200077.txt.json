      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "By depriving rural residents of their right to just say no to green energy scams, the state-level 'greenies' who control California, Illinois, Michigan and New York are pandering to corporate interests while lining their own pockets, all at the expense of their constituents.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the motives and economic impact of state-level green energy policies, framing them as 'scams' that benefit corporations and politicians at the expense of local residents, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Each of these so-called 'blue' states ... is controlled by far-left politicians who are in bed with the green energy industry.",
      "reasoning": "This statement challenges the integrity and intentions of state-level politicians and authorities, accusing them of being corruptly aligned with industry interests, which fits the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities in relation to climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Green energy is a scam that benefits communist China and other foreign interests at the expense of American energy independence.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly claims that green energy policies serve the interests of foreign powers (specifically China) and undermine national energy independence, framing them as tools for geopolitical influence rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "evidence_quote": "All that taxpayer cash being pumped into the green economy, supposedly to fight not just inflation but also climate change, is being used to drive family farmers off their land so it can be turned into another wind or solar farm, or perhaps the next carbon capture pipeline.",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that climate policy funding (the Inflation Reduction Act) leads to the direct negative economic outcome of displacing family farmers and taking their land, harming local economies and individuals."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by making a distinct argument not covered by the specific subnarratives: that the policies are a 'scam' that undermines national sovereignty and benefits foreign adversaries."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Many states where rural farmers now face assault by the green industry are taking advantage of the Biden regime's Inflation Reduction Act, which exists to help multinational corporations at the expense of mom-and-pop America.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the national government (the 'Biden regime') for enacting a policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) that is portrayed as harming American citizens to benefit corporations, fitting the definition of disapproval of how a national government handles climate-related policy."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes state-level bureaucratic institutions and authorities for overriding local governance and being corrupt, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit neatly into the more specific subcategories of national governments, EU, international entities, or solely political figures (as it targets bureaucrats and the structure of authority)."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames renewable energy policy as a massive, wasteful corporate giveaway, aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive and a poor use of resources."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by depicting them as a tool for domestic economic abuse and exploitation, using taxpayer money to dispossess citizens (farmers) for corporate gain. This theme of exploitative domestic policy does not fit the specific 'neo-colonialism' or 'international relations' subnarratives but clearly supports the overarching idea of green policies as manipulative instruments."

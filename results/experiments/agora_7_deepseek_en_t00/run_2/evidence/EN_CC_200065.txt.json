      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the scientific basis for claims about long-term temperature records by highlighting the short duration of instrumental data collection, casting doubt on the methods used to make historical comparisons."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses a NASA statement to question the validity and comparability of paleoclimate proxy data, which is central to the scientific claims being reported, thereby sowing doubt about the scientific methodology."

      "reasoning": "The term 'climate alarmists' is a pejorative label that challenges the motives and credibility of those raising climate concerns, framing their assertions as exaggerated or hysterical rather than scientific."

      "evidence_quote": "Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert...",
      "reasoning": "Describing the claims as 'extravagant' directly criticizes the climate movement and its messengers for what the text implies is overstatement or lack of restraint, challenging their integrity and impact."

      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question sarcastically implies that the reported climate science is not driven by evidence but is instead a sensational narrative, thereby downplaying the significance and factual basis of the climate change warnings."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by casting doubt on the claims of historical temperature extremes, but its argument—that the claims are invalid because direct measurement records are too short—does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question broadly criticizes the scientific institutions and authorities (like NASA, Copernicus, and the journals cited) by sarcastically accusing them of prioritizing a narrative over scientific rigor, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit a more specific subcategory like criticism of the EU or national governments."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames climate policy (in this case, guidelines on washing frequency) as an extreme and unjust infringement on personal rights, directly criticizing its impact and motives."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the WEF, accusing it of hypocrisy and of targeting ordinary citizens while protecting elite privileges."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "The text connects the WEF's environmental advocacy (the washing guidelines) with its praise for China's policies and its gathering of global elites, implying its 'green' agenda is intertwined with geopolitical alignment and elite networking rather than pure environmental concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote contrasts the proposed policy (restricting laundry) with the massive carbon footprint of the elites promoting it, implying the policy is an ineffective and hypocritical approach to addressing climate change, as it targets minor citizen behaviors while ignoring major polluters."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly argues that climate policies are designed to protect the financial and privileged status of elites ('billionaires and elites') while imposing burdens on ordinary citizens, framing the policies as a tool for maintaining power and profit rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by framing them as an extreme, rights-stripping overreach that infringes on personal dignity and fundamental freedoms, a theme not fully captured by the more specific economic or profit-driven subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the World Economic Forum, an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and ordering governments, portraying it as an overreaching authority imposing unreasonable climate-related policies on the public."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits political figures and elites ('globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians') by highlighting their hypocrisy in advocating for public sacrifice while engaging in high-carbon personal travel, thus criticizing them within the climate change debate."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities by accusing the WEF of protecting elite privileges while targeting citizens' rights, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of criticizing the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures alone. It is a broader criticism of the institution's motives and actions."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the application of environmental policy as a tool to exploit and abuse the rights of ordinary citizens while protecting elite privileges, framing climate action as an exploitative power dynamic."

      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote, combined with the context of the WEF's 'Summer Davos' being held in China and promoting global collaboration, supports the parent narrative by implying green/globalist policies are instruments for geopolitical alignment and influence, a theme not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."

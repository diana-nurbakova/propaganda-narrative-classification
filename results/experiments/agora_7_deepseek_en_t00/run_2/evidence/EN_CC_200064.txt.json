      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage during Sweden’s Strictly Come Dancing final over the weekend.",
      "reasoning": "The terms 'radical climate activist' and the description of the activist being physically knocked down frames the climate movement in a negative, disruptive, and potentially ridiculous light, challenging its integrity and methods."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "three climate change radicals stormed the stage.",
      "reasoning": "Labeling the activists as 'radicals' and describing their action as 'stormed the stage' portrays the climate movement as extreme and aggressive, criticizing its tactics and public impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, attributed to the activist group, explicitly emphasizes catastrophic and devastating consequences of climate change, which aligns with the narrative of amplifying fears about climate impacts."

      "evidence_quote": "Watch: Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane After Storming Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The term 'Eco-Loon' is a derogatory and dismissive label attacking the character and sanity of the activists, fitting the definition of ad hominem attacks on key activists."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the activists' actions as criminal (vandalism) and disruptive, which criticizes the climate movement's methods but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or solely 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote from the activist group presents a catastrophic, large-scale scenario of societal collapse as a direct result of climate change, which aligns with the definition of presenting intense catastrophic scenarios as results of climate change."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition?",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by justifying disruptive activism based on climate fears, but it does not fit neatly into the specific definitions of 'Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'Doomsday scenarios for humans', or 'Whatever we do it is already too late'. It is a distinct argument that leverages climate concern to rationalize extreme actions."

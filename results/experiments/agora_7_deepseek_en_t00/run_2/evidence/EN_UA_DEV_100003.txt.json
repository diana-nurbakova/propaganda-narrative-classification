      "evidence_quote": "\"Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote is a direct prediction and assumption about the potential future results of the conflict, specifically speculating that Russian troops will eventually take the Ukrainian capital."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement positively highlights Russia's territorial claims and actions, glorifying the idea of annexing Odesa by framing it as a 'homecoming' to Russia and emphasizing its Russian character."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "On the eve of its second anniversary, Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's, and a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests a decline in Ukrainian military effectiveness and strength by stating they are at a severe material disadvantage and facing a critical shortage of external support, which supports the subnarrative of the Ukrainian army collapsing."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on a future war outcome (the capture of Kyiv) but does not fit the specific definitions of 'Russian army is collapsing', 'Russian army will lose all occupied territories', or 'Ukrainian army is collapsing'. It is a speculative prediction of a Russian military advance, which is a core theme of the parent narrative 'Speculating war outcomes'."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian troops will go much further into Ukraine, taking the southern city of Odesa and might even one day push on to the capital Kyiv",
      "reasoning": "This statement projects confidence in the future offensive capabilities and expansion of the Russian military, positively highlighting its potential scale and reach."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin said Tuesday that Russian troops would push further into Ukraine to build on their success on the battlefield after the weekend fall of the town of Avdiivka where he said Ukrainian troops had been forced to flee in chaos.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Putin as a decisive leader announcing and building on military successes, presenting his strategic vision positively."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,\" Medvedev said.",
      "reasoning": "This statement portrays Russia's territorial ambitions as a benevolent 'homecoming' for a city, framing Russian control as a natural and positive outcome for its people, aligning with the idea of Russia providing prosperity and unity."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Russian invasion has strong national support",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict.",
      "reasoning": "This statement, while from the article's author, interprets Medvedev's hawkish stance as reflective of a broader confidence within the Russian leadership and, by implication, national support for the war's progression."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia says the territory its forces control is part of Russia and that it will never be given up.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by presenting Russia's position as resolute and justified, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about military might, Putin, peace/prosperity, or support). It is a distinct argument legitimizing Russia's territorial claims."

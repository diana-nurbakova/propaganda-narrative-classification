The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage directly criticizes the UK government's inconsistent and seemingly contradictory policy decisions and personnel changes regarding climate and energy, challenging the competence and coherence of the authorities in this area."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the government's climate policy approach by highlighting inconsistency and demoting key climate officials. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of being ineffective, economically harmful, or profit-driven."

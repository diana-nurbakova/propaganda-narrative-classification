      "evidence_quote": "After multiple instances of vandalism against famous landmarks and artistic works of western cultural significance, many people are growing annoyed with the actions of climate alarmists.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the actions and methods of climate activists, framing them as 'alarmists' whose vandalism is causing public annoyance, which aligns with the narrative of challenging the motives, integrity, or impact of the climate movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly criticizes the climate movement's public relations strategy, suggesting its actions are counterproductive and damaging to its own cause, which fits the definition of challenging the movement's impact and motives."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical '(it's not)' directly dismisses the legitimacy of man-made climate change as a threat, which is a clear statement minimizing the significance of climate change."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase suggests that predictions related to global warming (a core aspect of climate change) are exaggerated and fail to come true, thereby downplaying the reality and impact of climate change."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate protests will likely increase in the next two months, with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses the climate movement of exploiting normal seasonal weather to make exaggerated and unfulfilled predictions about global warming, framing their actions as alarmist and disconnected from reality."

      "evidence_quote": "Those \"Extinction Rebellion\" activists everyone loves to hate are at it again.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the activists as universally disliked ('everyone loves to hate'), which is an attack on their character and public reputation rather than engaging with their arguments."

      "evidence_quote": "Their defacement of Stonehenge could be considered relatively successful because no one was able to stop them. It's impossible to understand the logic behind the focus on an ancient site created thousands of year before the development of carbon based energy. However, climate activists seem to be more concerned with media coverage than making sense.",
      "reasoning": "This criticizes the movement's tactics as illogical, counterproductive, and driven by a desire for media attention rather than genuine environmental concern. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks on key individuals."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the movement's actions as self-defeating public relations, which is a form of criticism of the movement's strategy and effectiveness, supporting the parent narrative but not matching a specific subnarrative."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the effectiveness and environmental impact of a specific climate policy (wind farm development), framing it as contradictory ('green madness') and harmful, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The text uses politically charged labels ('leftist', 'leftist-separatist') for the Scottish government and the SNP, challenging their competence and intentions in managing environmental policy, thus criticizing the institution's integrity."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This quote lists multiple negative consequences (deforestation, wildlife harm, reliance on problematic mining) associated with wind turbines, expressing clear skepticism and criticism of this green technology."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "The quote connects a green policy (wind energy) to dependency on a geopolitical rival ('Communist China'), implying the policy serves or enables foreign power interests rather than being purely environmental."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses 'supposedly' to cast doubt on the environmental benefit of the wind farms, implying the policy of promoting 'green energy' is counterproductive and fails to achieve genuine environmental goals by destroying trees."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "“I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'damage to... business' as a concern raised by communities, directly linking the wind farm developments (a climate policy) to negative economic impacts on local enterprises."

      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes climate policies (wind energy) by highlighting severe negative social and environmental consequences in the supply chain (exploitation, health impacts) that are not covered by the other specific subnarratives about economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the actions and policies of the national (devolved) government of Scotland, framing its 'green energy' push as destructive and hypocritical."

      "reasoning": "The quote uses politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') to discredit the SNP and its representative, Mairi Gougeon, in the context of their climate and energy policies."

      "evidence_quote": "I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business. Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, from a political figure, criticizes the government's approach by highlighting opposition from communities and negative impacts, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing authorities. However, it does not neatly fit the specific definitions of criticizing the EU, international entities, national governments (already used), or political organizations/figures (already used) as its primary focus is on the policy's consequences and community backlash."

      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that the production of wind turbines relies on a mining process that causes severe health and environmental damage, framing renewable energy as dangerous to human health and ecosystems."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "Mr Kerr said: “Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,” adding that the government “must be alive” to the “significant costs” of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions the 'significant costs' of wind turbine installation, framing the development as having a high price, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by framing the adoption of wind energy as hypocritical ('supposedly green') and environmentally destructive (cutting down trees), which is a critique of green technology but does not fit neatly into the specific definitions of dangerous, unreliable, costly, or anti-nuclear."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames the green energy supply chain as exploitative, where the environmental and health costs of mining rare earth minerals for Western wind turbines are borne by local communities in China. This aligns with the subnarrative that green initiatives are a modern form of colonial control, where developed nations' 'green' goals impose severe harms on developing nations."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a national green policy (wind farm development) as hypocritical and destructive, framing it as a geopolitical instrument used by a specific government ('leftist Scottish Govt') to pursue an agenda at the expense of the local environment. It supports the parent narrative that green policies are tools for political/geopolitical ends, but does not fit the specific definitions of 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' as it focuses on domestic policy hypocrisy and environmental trade-offs within a single country."

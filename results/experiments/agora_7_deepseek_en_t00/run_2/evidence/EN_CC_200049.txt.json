      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the severity of a climate change impact (heat-related deaths) by presenting alternative data (cold-related deaths) to minimize the perceived threat and significance of climate change."

      "reasoning": "The text uses selective data from an official agency (EPA) to cast doubt on the scientific claim (from Science Alert) about the leading cause of weather-related deaths, thereby questioning the validity of the measurements and conclusions used to support climate change concerns."

      "evidence_quote": "Alarmists Warn of U.S. ‘Heat Dome’ Tied to Human-Induced Climate Change",
      "reasoning": "The term 'Alarmists' in the headline is a pejorative label that challenges the credibility and motives of those raising concerns about climate change, framing them as exaggerating or causing undue panic."

      "reasoning": "This quote presents a potential positive effect (a larger decrease in cold-related deaths) alongside a negative effect (increase in heat deaths) of global warming, implicitly arguing that climate change can have net beneficial outcomes for human mortality."

      "evidence_quote": "According to the Lancet, people around the world are 9.4 times more likely to die from the cold than from the heat. It added that over the past 20 years, the death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the net mortality impact of climate change is minimal or even beneficial, as the slight increase in heat deaths is offset by a larger decrease in cold deaths, thereby downplaying the significant negative impact of rising temperatures."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges a specific claim made by climate advocates (about heat being the leading cause of weather-related deaths) to undermine the perceived urgency and severity of climate change impacts. It supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the reliability of the claim about heat-related deaths being the leading cause, suggesting the underlying data or methodology used to support the climate change narrative is flawed and does not match the actual data from the EPA and CDC."

      "reasoning": "This quote uses data to downplay the severity of global warming by presenting a net benefit (a larger decrease in cold deaths) and minimizing the increase in heat deaths, implicitly questioning the alarmist narrative about temperature-driven risks."

      "reasoning": "The phrase 'regularly laments' frames the Lancet journal as having a biased, alarmist agenda, which serves to discredit the scientific community and its publications as unreliable or politically motivated rather than objective."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a factual claim made by the climate movement (represented by Science Alert), arguing it is factually incorrect. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.' It is a distinct form of criticism based on disputing data."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that a warming climate reduces cold-related mortality at a rate more than double the increase in heat-related mortality, framing global warming as a net benefit for human health by saving more lives from cold than it costs from heat."

      "reasoning": "This statement counters the alarm about heat-related deaths by presenting cold as the greater weather-related killer, implicitly suggesting that climate change (which reduces cold extremes) is beneficial by mitigating the larger threat. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific 'CO2 is beneficial' or 'Temperature increase is beneficial' definitions as neatly as the Lancet quote."

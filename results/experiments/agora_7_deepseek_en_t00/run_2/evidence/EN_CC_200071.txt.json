      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of living (housing, fuel, utilities) to green policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American... who warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Biden's policies as a 'globalist green agenda' with harmful consequences, challenging the competence and intentions of the administration and its institutions."
    },

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment...",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies (wind, solar, biomass), labeling them as inefficient, expensive, and environmentally destructive."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions whether green policies weaken national strength and resilience in a geopolitical context, implying they are tools that could undermine America's position against adversaries."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring. \"And these elevated prices for essentials factor into price increases for everything else.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of housing, fuel, and utilities to climate policies, arguing they negatively impact the economy and household affordability."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the promoted renewable energy sources are inefficient, environmentally destructive, and incapable of meeting energy demands, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended environmental and practical goals."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by framing them as a national security weakness, an argument not covered by the specific subnarratives of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "This direct quote criticizes the policies of a specific political figure (President Biden), linking them to negative economic consequences for citizens, which fits the definition of discrediting political figures in the climate debate."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes... Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the actions and policies of the U.S. federal government (the Biden administration's Department of Energy), specifically its handling of climate-related building regulations and their economic impact, which aligns with disapproval of how a national government handles climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The remainder of the fund will go toward implementing 'zero energy' building codes, which will require residential buildings to install small-scale renewable energy generators 'to achieve zero-net carbon.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes a specific government program and its mandated requirements, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities. However, the specific criticism of a federal energy program and its coercive funding mechanisms does not neatly fit the more specific subnarratives targeting the EU, international entities, national governments in general, or political figures specifically. It is a distinct, leftover piece of evidence."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are incapable of meeting the energy demands of the nation or world, which aligns with the definition of unreliability for widespread adoption."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly labels wind, solar, and biomass as 'inefficient and expensive,' directly supporting the subnarrative that renewable energy is too costly and inefficient for widespread use."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "\"BLINDED by MONEY: Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations.\"",
      "reasoning": "This headline claims wind farms are killing wildlife (eagles and whales), presenting renewable energy as posing significant risks and dangers to the environment."

      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of \"green\" policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This argument directly supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies by blaming them for broad affordability crises (housing, energy bills), but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about energy source danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy. It is a distinct, broader criticism of policy consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the domestic consequences of green policies (high prices, unaffordable housing) as a direct threat to national strength and security in the context of international conflict, implying these policies are an exploitative or abusive geopolitical instrument that weakens the nation."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Edward Ring... warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' frames the policies not as domestic environmental measures but as instruments of a supranational or international agenda, supporting the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments. This specific framing does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions but clearly supports the core idea of policies serving broader geopolitical aims."

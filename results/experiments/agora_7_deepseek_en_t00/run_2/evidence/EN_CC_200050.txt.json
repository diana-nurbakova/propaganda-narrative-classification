      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, implying that climate policies mandating such a shift are impractical and could harm energy security and developing nations."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF. The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the shift in bank investments as a response to pressure from activist groups and alliances like the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance, suggesting environmental policies are tools used to influence and control major financial institutions' behavior, aligning with the narrative that green policies serve as instruments of power and influence."

      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline uses the phrase 'Bend The Knee,' which frames the banks' actions as a submissive capitulation to the demands of climate activists, thereby challenging the legitimacy and impact of the climate movement by portraying it as a coercive force."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF. The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the banks' climate actions as financial investments ('investing $0.81... for every $1'), suggesting a primary motive of profit-seeking and capital allocation rather than purely environmental concern, aligning with the narrative that climate policies are driven by financial gain."

      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline's phrasing 'Bend The Knee To Climate Activists' frames the banks' policy changes as a form of capitulation to activist pressure rather than a rational or independent policy decision, which is a criticism of climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the global push for a 'quick shift to renewables' as potentially exploitative, highlighting that developing nations lack the resources and infrastructure to comply, which could place them at an economic disadvantage. This supports the idea that international climate policies are economically abusive by forcing a transition that is not feasible for all nations."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The statement implies that developed nations and their financial institutions (like Citi) are setting the agenda for a global energy transition. By highlighting that developing nations lack the capacity to shift quickly, it suggests that green policies imposed by international alliances (like the Net Zero Banking Alliance) are a form of control, dictating the economic and energy development paths of less powerful nations, akin to neo-colonial practices."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios... New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This describes how green policies are being enforced through financial coercion and pressure from activist investors and public officials, using economic threats (pulling pension funds) to compel banks to adopt specific climate agendas. This supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments, but the specific mechanism of domestic financial coercion does not fit neatly into the 'abusive international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote, by highlighting the financial investment ratio, frames the climate movement's influence on banks as driven by financial interests and market pressures rather than purely environmental concerns, suggesting ulterior economic motives behind the actions."

      "reasoning": "The headline uses the phrase 'Bend The Knee,' which frames the banks' actions as submissive surrender to activist pressure, criticizing the climate movement's tactics and influence without fitting neatly into the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

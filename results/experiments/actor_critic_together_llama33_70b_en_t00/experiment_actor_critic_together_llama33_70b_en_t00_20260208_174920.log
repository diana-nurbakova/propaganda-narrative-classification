[graph] Fuzzy matched 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is not mentioned as weak in this context, but rather Russia's military is; however, this can be seen as a form of discrediting the West's opponent, thus fitting the parent narrative. The closest subnarrative is: URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting is not applicable, but the narrative of Russia's failure can be seen as a way to discredit their actions, thus we can consider 'Other'' -> 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting' (score: 100.0)

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate cultists push bizarre scare language about weather: “rain bombs” and “boiling oceans”",
      "reasoning": "The opening phrase 'Climate cultists' is a derogatory term that challenges the integrity and motives of the climate movement, framing its language as 'bizarre' and fear-mongering."

      "evidence_quote": "\"That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers, and the rain bombs, and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level, and causing these waves of climate refugees, predicted to reach one billion in this century.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quoted statement from Al Gore, presented in the text, lists a catastrophic chain of consequences (boiling oceans, droughts, sea-level rise, a billion refugees) which serves as a clear example of amplifying fears about climate change impacts."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for \"renewable energy,\" meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the Inflation Reduction Act's funding for renewable energy, questioning its effectiveness and economic impact by suggesting it will lead to a 'dark and cold future,' thereby challenging the policy's motives and outcomes."

      "evidence_quote": "\"I have been hearing about these end of the world scenarios since I was a kid. And not one of their predictions has come true. Global cooling, global warming, mass extinction, mass famine, the polar ice caps melting, mass flooding, the ozone layer depleted, etc.\"",
      "reasoning": "This commenter's statement minimizes the significance and credibility of climate change concerns by asserting that past predictions have consistently failed, thereby downplaying the overall threat."

      "evidence_quote": "Climate cultists push bizarre scare language about weather: “rain bombs” and “boiling oceans”",
      "reasoning": "The opening phrase labels climate activists as 'cultists' and characterizes their terminology as 'bizarre scare language,' directly suggesting they are exaggerating and using alarmist rhetoric to frighten the public."

      "reasoning": "This quote attacks the personal credibility and integrity of Al Gore, a key climate activist, by highlighting his alleged hypocrisy and lavish lifestyle, rather than engaging with his arguments."

      "reasoning": "This quote from a commenter criticizes the climate movement by claiming its predictions have consistently failed, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem' subnarratives. It is a distinct argument about the movement's track record."

      "reasoning": "This quote presents a catastrophic chain of events (boiling oceans, droughts, sea level rise, a billion refugees) as a direct result of climate change, fitting the definition of presenting intense catastrophic scenarios for humans."

      "evidence_quote": "\"We're still putting 162 million tons [of greenhouse gas pollution into the atmosphere] every single day, and the accumulated amount is now trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every single day on the Earth,\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement uses the extreme and frightening analogy of daily atomic bomb explosions to amplify existing fears about the heat-trapping effects of greenhouse gases and global warming."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Rain bombs? Bomb cyclones? Atmospheric rivers? They really are losing their minds,\" wrote a commenter about how all sorts of common weather events now have scary new names aimed at frightening the general public...",
      "reasoning": "This quote, and the surrounding commentary, supports the parent narrative by arguing that climate advocates are deliberately using alarming, fear-inducing language ('rain bombs', 'bomb cyclones') to manipulate the public, which is a tactic of amplifying climate fears not captured by the other specific subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that the predictions and warnings used to justify climate policies have consistently failed, implying the policies based on them are ineffective."

      "evidence_quote": "\"The legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for 'renewable energy,' meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames climate policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) as a massive expenditure that will lead to a negative outcome ('a very dark and cold future'), suggesting economic waste and harm to living standards."

      "reasoning": "This quote attacks a key proponent of climate policies, Al Gore, by highlighting his personal fossil fuel use and lavish lifestyle, implying hypocrisy and that the movement is driven by personal gain rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "reasoning": "This opening statement criticizes the language and communication tactics of climate advocates, framing them as alarmist and irrational ('cultists', 'bizarre scare language'). This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies/movements but does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change by dismissing climate concerns as failed alarmist predictions, but it does not align with any of the specific scientific denial subnarratives provided (e.g., natural cycles, human impact, sea levels). It is a general rebuttal of climate science credibility."

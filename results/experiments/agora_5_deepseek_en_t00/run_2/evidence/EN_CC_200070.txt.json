      "evidence_quote": "burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the mayor's decision to travel to a climate summit, framing it as hypocritical and ineffective, questioning the practical impact and wisdom of the policy action (attending the summit) in light of its carbon cost and opportunity cost regarding local issues."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "White Garcetti was away, Los Angeles continued to struggle with the high crime and homelessness that have come to define his legacy, as well as a crisis in the City Council triggered by racist comments from City Council members within Garcetti’s party.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Mayor Garcetti's competence and priorities by highlighting domestic crises (crime, homelessness, political scandal) that persisted or were neglected while he was abroad, challenging his effectiveness and integrity as a leader."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implicitly challenges the sincerity and practicality of the climate movement's actions, suggesting that a key event (the summit) is being conducted in a manner (in-person travel) that contradicts its stated environmental goals, thereby questioning the movement's motives or logic."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific climate policy (the Green New Deal) by highlighting its political opposition and electoral failure, suggesting it is not achieving its intended goals and is therefore ineffective."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action – it’s a chance to elevate the solutions cities are deploying at a neighborhood level that have a real impact on people’s daily lives.",
      "reasoning": "The article frames the summit and Garcetti's participation as hypocritical and performative, implying the actions are for show and political/career elevation rather than genuine environmental concern, aligning with the idea that such policies are driven by gain (in this case, political/image gain) rather than sincere motives."

      "evidence_quote": "burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the method of implementing climate policy (attending an in-person summit) as hypocritical and counterproductive, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Mayor Eric Garcetti's performance and legacy, focusing on domestic failures (crime, homelessness) and a political crisis within his party, thereby discrediting him as a political figure in the context of his climate-focused trip."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",

      "reasoning": "This statement expresses disapproval of the decision-making and actions of the summit organizers (an institutional authority) for holding an in-person event, implying hypocrisy or inefficiency. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit the specific definitions targeting the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures."

      "evidence_quote": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined a “global coalition of mayors” at a summit on climate change this week in Buenos Aires, Argentina, burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights hypocrisy and ulterior motives by suggesting the mayor's actions (flying to a climate summit) contradict the movement's stated goals, implying the movement is not sincere and is engaged in corrupt or unethical practices like virtue signaling."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement by arguing it diverts attention and resources from more pressing local issues, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks on key activists'."

      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the destruction of 'street zone sectioning barriers' as a positive act of resistance, directly criticizing the specific climate or urban policy (likely related to traffic or low-emission zones) that implemented them."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' dismisses the concerns and actions of the climate movement as irrational or extreme, challenging its legitimacy and impact."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con...",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate change as 'The Climate Con' characterizes it as a deception or scam, which directly downplays its scientific reality and significance."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The act of residents destroying the barriers implies a rejection of the policy's implementation and legitimacy, suggesting it is not achieving its intended goal of public compliance and is therefore ineffective."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate policies as irrational and extreme, which is a criticism of the policies themselves but does not fit the specific definitions of being ineffective, economically harmful, or profit-driven."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames the climate movement's agenda as irrational and hysterical, aligning with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist and exaggerating the issue."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "The repeated labeling of climate action as 'The Climate Con' directly alleges the movement is a fraudulent scheme or scam, implying corruption and ulterior motives, which matches the definition of the subnarrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "This quote and the overall text's celebration of direct action and resistance against specific climate policies (like street zoning) supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement, but does not fit the specific definitions of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate change action as irrational or extreme, which is a form of downplaying its seriousness and legitimacy, but does not fit any of the more specific scientific or impact-based subnarratives provided."

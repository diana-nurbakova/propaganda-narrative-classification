      "reasoning": "The text uses selective data from an official agency (EPA) to cast doubt on the scientific assertion that heat-related deaths are the leading weather-related cause, thereby questioning the evidence base for climate change impacts."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames global warming as having a net beneficial effect by arguing it reduces cold-related mortality more than it increases heat-related mortality, presenting climate change in a positive light."

      "evidence_quote": "According to the Lancet, people around the world are 9.4 times more likely to die from the cold than from the heat. It added that over the past 20 years, the death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the net mortality impact of climate change is minimal or even beneficial, as cold-related deaths far outnumber and are decreasing faster than heat-related deaths, thereby downplaying the significance of the temperature increase."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges a specific claim made by climate advocates (about heat being the leading cause of weather deaths) to undermine the perceived urgency and severity of climate change impacts. It supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the reliability of the claim made by 'Science Alert' and the underlying data or methodology used to support the assertion that heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, implying the metrics used are flawed."

      "reasoning": "This quote uses data to suggest that the net effect of temperature changes (implicitly linked to climate change) is a significant decrease in cold-related mortality, which is framed as a benefit, thereby questioning the severity and negative impact of the temperature increase claimed by climate alarmists."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the overarching narrative that climate change is beneficial by directly challenging the premise that heat (and by extension, climate change) is a major threat, instead arguing that cold is the real danger. This argument implies that a warmer climate would be less deadly, which is a beneficial claim not fully captured by the specific CO2 or temperature increase subnarratives."

It is a substantive critique of the movement's messaging."

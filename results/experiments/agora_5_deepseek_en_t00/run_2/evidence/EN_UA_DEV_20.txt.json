      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto Western nations (the UK and US), framing them as the actors who prevented a peaceful settlement."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Western (and Ukrainian) policy as reckless and counterproductive, directly discrediting their diplomatic and military choices as escalatory and pointless."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This language evokes fear by suggesting that current Western-supported actions are moving the world toward a catastrophic nuclear event, amplifying anxieties about the conflict's potential global consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the continuation of the war from Russia to Western powers, portraying the UK and US as the actors who prevented a peaceful settlement and chose to escalate the conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the prolongation of the war on Ukraine and its Western backers for choosing escalation over negotiation, which is a distinct argument not fully captured by the specific 'West are the aggressors' subnarrative focused on initial aggression."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly contrasts Russia's strong and increasing military production with the West's comparatively weaker output, presenting the West as non-potent and unable to match Russia's war effort."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims Western powers (UK and US) sabotaged a potential peace deal that would have benefited Ukraine, prioritizing a continued conflict (presumably for their own geopolitical interests) over Ukrainian lives and sovereignty."

      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "This concluding statement frames current Western policy as a fantasy of military victory and explicitly calls for a shift to diplomacy ('words'), implying that the current Western approach of supporting Ukraine militarily is a failure and that diplomatic efforts are being ignored or dismissed."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by accusing the West (and Ukraine) of reckless escalation that prolongs suffering, a theme that criticizes Western diplomatic and military strategy but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about weakness, division, overreaction, lack of care, diplomatic failure, or fatigue)."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly warns against continuing a military offensive against Russia, framing it as a dangerous fantasy that could lead to a major, potentially world-scale conflict, and urges a diplomatic solution 'before it’s too late', evoking fear of escalation to a world war."

      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by describing a specific, escalatory action (allowing strikes inside Russia with NATO weapons) that increases the risk of a broader, more dangerous conflict, but it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarrative definitions provided."

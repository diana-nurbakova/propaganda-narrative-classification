      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the US motivation for involvement in the war as securing access to mineral resources, implying the conflict is driven by Western economic interests rather than Russia's invasion, thereby shifting blame for the war's continuation away from Russia."

'The fate of the colonies is always the same: the Americans will scoop up all the natural resources of Ukraine in exchange for 'the great honor of being a friend of the United States''",
      "reasoning": "The text, through the Russian official's statement, directly criticizes and portrays US foreign policy and diplomatic efforts as colonialist and exploitative, aiming to discredit Western intentions and actions."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by blaming the war on the West's alleged colonial and corrupting influence, but it introduces additional specific elements (corrupt neo-Nazi regime) not fully captured by the 'West are the aggressors' subnarrative alone."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames Western (specifically US) support for Ukraine not as a principled stand, but as a self-interested economic calculation to secure access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, disregarding Ukraine's sovereignty and fate."

      "reasoning": "This statement, and the subsequent colonial framing, supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying it as fundamentally exploitative and imperialistic, which is a distinct theme not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."

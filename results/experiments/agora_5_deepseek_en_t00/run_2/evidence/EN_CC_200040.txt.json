    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "After multiple instances of vandalism against famous landmarks and artistic works of western cultural significance, many people are growing annoyed with the actions of climate alarmists.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the actions and methods of climate activists, framing them as 'alarmists' whose vandalism is causing public annoyance, which aligns with the narrative of challenging the motives, integrity, or impact of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical statement '(it's not)' explicitly denies that man-made climate change is a legitimate threat, which directly minimizes the significance and validity of climate change."
    }
  ],
  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "send their message of doom",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'message of doom' frames the climate movement's communication as excessively pessimistic and fear-mongering, aligning with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "global warming predictions that never seem to materialize",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly accuses climate predictions of being false or exaggerated, a core tenet of the 'alarmist' subnarrative which claims the movement exaggerates the severity of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "climate activists seem to be more concerned with media coverage than making sense",
      "reasoning": "This alleges that the activists' primary motive is not a genuine environmental concern but rather gaining media attention, suggesting ulterior, self-serving motives which fits the 'corrupt' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Their defacement of Stonehenge... disrupting the PGA Tour’s Travelers Championship... this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "This criticizes the climate movement's tactics as counterproductive, alienating the public, and damaging to their own cause. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem' definitions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Human activities do not impact climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "This direct statement explicitly denies that human-caused (man-made) climate change is a real threat, which matches the definition of the subnarrative that climate change is not caused by human activity."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda, blind belief in climate hysteria is on the decline.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase frames mainstream climate science and concern as 'propaganda' and 'hysteria,' which supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change. However, the specific argument—that belief is declining due to propaganda exposure—does not fit any of the other provided subnarrative definitions about natural cycles, weather, CO2 impact, etc."

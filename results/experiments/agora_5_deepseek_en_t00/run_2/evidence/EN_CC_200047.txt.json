      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policies (specifically rationing plans) as a negative imposition on the public, using the word 'allegedly' to cast doubt on the stated motive of fighting climate change, which aligns with the narrative of questioning the effectiveness or motives behind such policies."

      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the 'American elites' and the WEF, labeling their policies as 'tyrannical' and placing 'climate' in scare quotes, which challenges the integrity and intentions of these authorities and institutions."

      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The text presents the WEF's 'Net Zero' agenda and the support from 'American elites' as a coordinated plan to impose restrictive policies on the general public, suggesting a hidden scheme by powerful groups to control resources and lifestyle under the guise of climate action."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "The report includes polling data regarding support for policies designed to force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda' implies that these environmental policies are tools used by an international organization (the WEF) to exert control and influence, aligning with the narrative that green policies serve as geopolitical instruments rather than genuine environmental measures."

      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The use of scare quotes around 'climate' and the descriptor 'tyrannical' frames the policies as illegitimate and not genuinely aimed at solving an environmental problem, implying they are ineffective for their stated purpose."

      "reasoning": "The plan to ration essential goods like gas, electricity, and food (meat/dairy) is presented as a direct negative intervention in the economy and daily life, impacting public access to resources and quality of life."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Reporting on the story, The College Fix writes that the “Committee to Unleash Prosperity [CUP], in a survey that sought to measure the beliefs of ‘elites,’ stated the findings reveal climate change ‘is clearly an obsession of the very rich and highly educated.’”",
      "reasoning": "This frames climate change action as an 'obsession' of a wealthy, out-of-touch elite class, suggesting the policies serve their interests or worldview rather than addressing a genuine public concern, aligning with the idea that the agenda is driven by a privileged group's motives."

      "evidence_quote": "In fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes climate policies by associating their supporters with a desire to reduce personal liberty and freedom, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific subnarratives about economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Astonishingly, the polling shows that almost 90 percent of “American elites” believe strict rationing of gas, meat, and electricity is necessary to combat the so-called “climate crisis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote discredits a specific political group ('American elites' from top universities) by portraying their beliefs as extreme and out of touch with the general public, which fits the definition of criticizing political organizations and figures in the climate change debate."

      "evidence_quote": "In fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the attitudes of 'elites' regarding liberty and governance, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about the EU, international entities, national governments, or political organizations in the context of climate policy. It is a broader criticism of elite authority and values."

      "reasoning": "The use of 'allegedly' casts doubt on the stated motive of fighting climate change, implying the rationing plan is driven by ulterior motives, such as control or reducing the public's quality of life, rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by presenting green policies (the Net Zero agenda) as instruments of coercion ('force compliance') orchestrated by an international entity (the WEF). It is a distinct argument about forced implementation that is not fully captured by the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives."

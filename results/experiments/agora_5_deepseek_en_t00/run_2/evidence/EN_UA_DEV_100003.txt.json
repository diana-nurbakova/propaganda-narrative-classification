      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on a future war outcome (the capture of Kyiv) that does not fit the specific definitions of 'Russian army is collapsing', 'Russian army will lose all occupied territories', or 'Ukrainian army is collapsing'. It is a speculative prediction of a Russian military advance, which supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes."

      "reasoning": "This statement, while reporting on Medvedev's comments, presents the Russian leadership's perspective of growing confidence and strategic advantage, which supports the overarching narrative of praising Russia's position and prospects, but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

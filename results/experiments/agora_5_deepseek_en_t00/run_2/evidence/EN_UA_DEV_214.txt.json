      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes and delegitimizes NATO, portraying it as an outdated and aggressive tool of American foreign policy, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Western institutions and diplomacy."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China. So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict... it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "This statement shifts the blame for the war's continuation and enabling away from Russia (the invader) and onto China and the West, suggesting they are responsible for the conflict rather than Russia's initial invasion."

      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's government and military efforts by portraying its defense as a callous sacrifice of its own citizens, attacking the legitimacy and morality of Ukraine's actions."

      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear by predicting the expansion of the conflict into a global or world war, specifically a 'third one', which is designed to create anxiety about severe consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This highlights a negative outcome for the West (depleting its own arsenals without achieving victory), which fits the narrative of predicting or reporting adverse consequences for Western interests."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This statement questions the reliability and integrity of Western mainstream media and official narratives, framing them as 'nonsense' believed only by a select few, thereby undermining confidence in these information sources."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims the West is willing to prolong the war in Ukraine for its own strategic benefit (expanding to Asia), showing a callous disregard for Ukrainian lives, which are dismissed as expendable 'cannon fodder'."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war. Seriously.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the West's massive military support for Ukraine as excessive and futile ('still not winning'), while sarcastically dismissing the West's attribution of blame to China, portraying the Western response as disproportionate and misguided."

      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying NATO not as a legitimate defensive alliance but as an aggressive, expansionist tool of American power, which is a distinct argument not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the war's continuation and escalation onto the West, framing the conflict as a Western 'proxy war' and portraying Western military aid as the primary driver, while dismissing accusations against the actual invader (Russia) and instead blaming the West for scapegoating China."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West for prolonging and expanding the war for its own strategic purposes, and also blames the Ukrainian government ('Kyiv') for sacrificing its own people. This fits the broader narrative of blaming others (the West and Ukraine's leadership) rather than the invader (Russia), but does not align perfectly with the two specific subnarratives provided."

      "evidence_quote": "Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly portrays the Ukrainian government's mobilization policies as cruel, desperate, and incompetent, treating its own citizens as expendable resources, which aligns with the definition of delegitimizing the government and its actions."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine?... the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict...",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'proxy war' frames the conflict in Ukraine as a war orchestrated and fueled by the West, with Ukraine acting as its instrument, thereby supporting the narrative that Ukraine is not an independent actor but a pawn of Western powers."

      "reasoning": "This statement presents the war as a protracted, unwinnable conflict of attrition where Ukrainian lives are being sacrificed for a futile cause, portraying a bleak and hopeless future for the country."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the expansion of the conflict as the start of a third world war, evoking fear of a global escalation from the current war in Ukraine."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China... But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition, then expand it to Asia.",
      "reasoning": "The text claims the West's strategy is to expand the war from Eastern Europe to Asia, implying a broadening of the conflict to involve other countries and regions, which aligns with the fear that Russia's actions or the war's dynamics will lead to attacks elsewhere."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "Alarmingly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Nato as playing a “bridge” between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific theatres.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests NATO is positioning itself to directly intervene and connect conflicts across different regions, indicating a shift towards broader, more direct military involvement beyond its traditional Euro-Atlantic scope."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Nato barbarians are expanding and gathering at the gate of Asia... A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This language amplifies war-related fears by depicting NATO as an aggressive, expansionist force threatening Asia, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions about WW3, nuclear weapons, or attacks on specific countries."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western military support for Ukraine is depleting their own arsenals ('emptying their own weapons warehouses') and is failing to achieve victory ('still not winning'), which catastrophizes the negative, self-harming consequences of Western actions."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western/American actions are leading to catastrophic global consequences—specifically, the expansion of conflict and the risk of a third world war. This is a negative consequence for the West and the world, but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses Western mainstream newsrooms of being part of a 'dis-information war' and implies they propagate 'nonsense' that is only believed within their own circles, framing them as instruments of propaganda for Western power corridors."

      "evidence_quote": "Given his obvious mental decline, US President Joe Biden may be forgiven for claiming to ABC News’ host George Stephanopoulos that he was indispensable: “You know, not only am I campaigning, but I’m running the world.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits a specific Western media interview (ABC News) by framing the President's claim as a symptom of 'mental decline', thereby casting doubt on the credibility and seriousness of the media platform hosting and reporting on such statements, which supports the broader narrative of distrust towards media."

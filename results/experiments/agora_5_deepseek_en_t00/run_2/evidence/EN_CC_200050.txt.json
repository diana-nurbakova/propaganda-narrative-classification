      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Both U.S.-based bank Citi and German Deutsche Bank announced plans to reduce investments in coal this week, the latest step in the movement amongst major banks to reduce their funding of fossil fuels and other industries that produce greenhouse gasses.",
      "reasoning": "The headline and opening paragraph frame the banks' climate-related investment decisions as 'bending the knee to climate activists,' which implicitly criticizes the policies as being driven by activist pressure rather than sound economic or environmental reasoning."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Both banks are founding members of the United Nations’ Net Zero Banking Alliance, which requires its 126 members to set goals and disclose financial data related to their efforts to reduce the emissions of their lending portfolio to net zero by 2050.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the role of the United Nations' alliance in setting requirements for banks, suggesting that global environmental policies are being used to exert influence and control over financial institutions and their investment portfolios."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios",
      "reasoning": "The text describes banks as facing pressure from 'activist investors' and 'activist groups,' framing the climate movement as applying coercive pressure on financial institutions, which aligns with challenging the motives and impact of the climate movement."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF. The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the banks' climate-related actions primarily as financial investment decisions ('investing $0.81... for every $1'), suggesting the shift is driven by profit-seeking in a growing 'green energy' market rather than by genuine environmental concern, aligning with the subnarrative that climate policies are profit-driven."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "\"On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote, from the Citigroup CEO, implies that aggressive climate policies (a 'quick shift to renewables') could undermine energy security and economic stability, particularly for developing nations, which aligns with the subnarrative that such policies have negative economic impacts."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline's phrasing ('Bend The Knee To Climate Activists') frames the banks' policy changes as a submission to external pressure from a specific ideological group, criticizing the motivation behind the policies. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the definitions of the specific economic, effectiveness, or profit-driven subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the global push for a 'quick shift to renewables' as potentially exploitative, highlighting that developing nations lack the resources and infrastructure to comply, which could place them at an economic disadvantage dictated by international climate policies and alliances like the Net Zero Banking Alliance."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The statement implies that the transition to renewables, driven by international banking alliances and activist pressure from developed nations, is being imposed on developing countries without regard for their specific economic realities and infrastructure needs, echoing neo-colonial patterns of external control over development paths."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, by highlighting the financial investment ratio, frames the climate movement's influence on banks as driven by financial interests and market pressures rather than purely environmental concerns, suggesting ulterior motives or a corrupting influence of capital."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios... New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This passage portrays climate activists (specifically 'activist investors' and the New York City Comptroller) as using coercive financial threats ('threatened to pull pension funds') to pressure banks, attacking their methods and implying they are unreasonable or overbearing, which aligns with ad hominem attacks on key figures in the movement."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline's phrase 'Bend The Knee' frames the banks' actions as a submissive surrender to the demands of climate activists, which criticizes the movement's power and influence in a way that doesn't neatly fit the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks, but still supports the overarching criticism of the climate movement."

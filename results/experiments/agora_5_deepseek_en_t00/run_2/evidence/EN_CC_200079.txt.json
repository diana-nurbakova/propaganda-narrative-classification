    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policy (in this case, guidelines on washing frequency) as an unjust infringement on fundamental personal rights, questioning its motives and impact on daily life."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the WEF, accusing it of hypocrisy and of targeting ordinary citizens while protecting elite privileges."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "The text connects the WEF's environmental advocacy (the washing guidelines) with its praise for China's policies and its gathering of global elites, suggesting environmental policies are tools for geopolitical alignment and consolidating elite power rather than genuine environmental concern."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The language ('ordered compliant governments', 'move towards a future') portrays the WEF as a shadowy, powerful entity orchestrating a global plan to restrict personal freedoms, fitting the narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "According to the WEF, the global fashion industry is estimated to generate 92 million tonnes of textile waste each year, and the public must reduce amount by wearing dirty clothes instead of washing them after use.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the proposed policy (wearing clothes longer without washing) as an absurd and impractical solution to textile waste, implicitly criticizing it as an ineffective way to address environmental concerns."

      "evidence_quote": "The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "This statement suggests climate policies (restricting clothing purchases) would directly limit consumer choice and economic activity in the retail sector, portraying a negative economic impact."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote contrasts elite behavior with proposed public restrictions, implying the policies are hypocritical and serve to protect the privileges and profits of the wealthy rather than genuinely address climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by framing climate policies as an unjust infringement on fundamental personal rights and dignity, which is a distinct criticism not covered by the other specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and ordering governments, portraying it as an overreaching authority imposing unreasonable lifestyle changes on the public under the guise of climate policy."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits the political figures and elites associated with the WEF (described as 'globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians') by highlighting their hypocrisy in advocating for public sacrifice while engaging in high-carbon personal travel."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities (the WEF) but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives. It accuses the WEF of protecting elite privileges while designing environmental policies that target and strip rights from ordinary citizens, which is a broader criticism of its motives and actions."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames international climate policy (promoted by the WEF) as an exploitative tool used by elites to impose burdens on ordinary citizens while protecting their own privileges, fitting the definition of criticizing climate-related international relations as abusive."

      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote, combined with the context of the article criticizing the WEF's 'globalist' agenda, suggests green policies are instruments of geopolitical alignment and elite collaboration, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting the more specific 'neo-colonialism' or 'abusive relations' definitions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Blaming global elites",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes the hypocrisy and environmental impact to 'globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians,' framing them as a secretive, powerful elite group (the WEF/Davos attendees) who impose rules on the public while exempting themselves."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims the climate agenda (restricting laundry) is not about the environment but is a tool used by elites to strip away citizens' fundamental rights, revealing an ulterior motive of control and maintaining elite privilege."

The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "This describes a secretive, powerful group (the WEF) issuing binding orders to governments to impose severe lifestyle restrictions on the public, supporting the parent narrative of hidden plots. It does not neatly fit the 'Blaming global elites' (which focuses on attributing blame) or 'Climate agenda has hidden motives' (which focuses on the motive) subnarratives, as it primarily establishes the plot and the mechanism of control."

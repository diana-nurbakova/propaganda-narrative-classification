    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism. Run your eye down the contributors to The Climate Book and you can see who she’s been reading: Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Naomi Klein. For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Greta Thunberg and her associates as having a hidden, radical political agenda (anti-capitalism, de-growth) that goes beyond genuine environmental concern, challenging the motives and integrity of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "The quote, attributed to Thunberg but presented in a context that amplifies its criticism, directly questions the effectiveness and motives behind a major international climate policy framework (COP), labeling it a deceptive scheme."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "The concluding statement explicitly claims that the climate agenda is a tool for a radical political transformation aimed at undermining Western civilization, framing environmental policies as instruments for geopolitical and ideological power struggles."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement suggests the true, hidden purpose of the mainstream climate agenda is a radical political takeover, implying a deceptive scheme by activists and intellectuals to advance a secret plot under the guise of environmentalism."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses the metaphor of an 'alarm bell' and 'Cassandra' to frame Thunberg's activism as inherently alarmist and focused on exaggerated warnings."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'demented manifesto' is a direct personal attack on Greta Thunberg, attacking her character and the substance of her message."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by alleging its true goal is a radical political ideology, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly characterizes a major international climate policy framework (COP) as a deceptive scheme for 'greenwashing', implying the policies are not genuine but are used for dishonest profit or image management."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism... For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism... The only solution to this state of emergency is for rich countries to immediately abandon economic expansion as a social goal.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes climate policies by framing them as a radical, anti-capitalist political ideology (Thunbergism) aimed at dismantling the economic system, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of being ineffective, economically harmful, or profit-driven."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Normal” was the “system” which gave us the climate crisis, a system of “colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide”, of “racist, oppressive extractionism”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the climate crisis and the system that caused it in terms of colonialism and imperialism, suggesting that green activism is a response to and a critique of these historical and ongoing exploitative practices, aligning with the idea of green initiatives as a form of anti-colonial or neo-colonial critique."

      "reasoning": "This concluding statement explicitly frames the climate movement as a geopolitical instrument aimed at destroying Western civilization and its values, which supports the parent narrative that green policies are tools for geopolitical ends, but does not fit neatly into the 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives. It presents a distinct argument about ideological warfare and regime change."

      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that the stated goal of the climate agenda is a deceptive cover for a different, radical political motive, aligning with the definition of the climate action push being driven by ulterior motives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "We can’t trust the elites produced by this system to confront its flaws – that’s why she, much like Rishi Sunak, won’t be bothering with the COP meeting this year. COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by portraying international climate institutions (COP) as a deceptive front run by untrustworthy elites, which is a claim of secretive, powerful group manipulation but does not fit the specific definitions of blaming global elites or stating hidden motives for the agenda itself."

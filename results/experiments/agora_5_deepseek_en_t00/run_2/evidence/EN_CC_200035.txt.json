      "reasoning": "This quote questions the economic impact and feasibility of the policy by highlighting the unknown financial burden on taxpayers, aligning with the narrative's definition of questioning the effectiveness and economic impact of climate policies."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses skepticism and criticism of the green technology (EV/battery) initiative by associating it with foreign geopolitical adversaries, suggesting controversy and negative consequences beyond environmental goals."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the green energy policy (EV fleet transition) as being intertwined with investments linked to a foreign power (CCP), implying the policy is a tool for or is influenced by geopolitical interests rather than purely environmental concerns."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the policy by highlighting strong local opposition and political consequences, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly highlights the unknown financial burden of the transition, framing it as a potentially expensive and risky undertaking for taxpayers, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable/green technologies are costly."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)... The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "This section criticizes the green energy transition by associating it with foreign (Chinese) influence, political unpopularity, and negative local consequences. It supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies but does not fit the definitions of 'dangerous', 'unreliable', 'costly', or 'nuclear not climate friendly'."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links the state's green energy policy (electrifying the fleet) to foreign investment and influence from China, framing it as an entanglement with a foreign power, which aligns with the idea of green initiatives being a tool for external control, a modern form of neo-colonial influence."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by highlighting a specific instance where a climate-related industrial project (an EV battery plant) is tied to a foreign political entity (the CCP), suggesting the policy serves broader strategic or geopolitical interests beyond environmental goals. This specific argument about foreign corporate involvement does not fit the 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions precisely, as it focuses on domestic policy being influenced by foreign ties."

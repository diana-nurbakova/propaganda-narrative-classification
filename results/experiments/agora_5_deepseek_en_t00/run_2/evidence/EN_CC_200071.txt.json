      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of essential goods and housing to 'green' policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly challenges the competence and impact of the Biden administration's policies, framing them as harmful to the average American, which fits the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses strong skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar, labeling them as inefficient, expensive, environmentally destructive, and incapable of meeting energy needs, which aligns with the controversy about green technologies narrative."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote, following criticism of green policies, frames them as weakening America's geopolitical and military strength, suggesting they are tools that undermine national power rather than being purely environmental, fitting the narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments."

      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that climate policies are causing unaffordable housing, rent, gasoline, and utility bills, which are negative economic outcomes for average Americans."

      "reasoning": "This statement argues that the promoted renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are environmentally destructive and incapable of meeting energy needs, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended environmental and practical goals."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames climate policies as undermining national security and military strength, which is a criticism of the policies but does not fit the definitions of the other specific subnarratives (economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive)."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the policies of a specific political figure (President Biden), blaming his 'green policies' for negative economic consequences, which fits the definition of discrediting political figures in the climate change debate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes... Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the actions of a U.S. government department (Department of Energy) and the broader federal administration for implementing policies (green building codes) that are portrayed as burdensome and financially damaging, which constitutes disapproval of how the national government handles climate change."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the underlying approach and rationale of 'green' energy policy itself, which is a broader criticism of the authorities and institutions promoting it. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit neatly into the specific subcategories of criticizing the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures alone; it targets the foundational logic of the policy agenda."

      "evidence_quote": "These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are incapable of meeting the energy demands of the nation or world, which aligns with the definition of unreliability for widespread adoption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly labels renewable energy sources as 'expensive' and 'inefficient', directly matching the subnarrative definition that they are too costly and inefficient for widespread use."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "BLINDED by MONEY: Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations.",
      "reasoning": "This headline claims wind farms are killing wildlife (eagles and whales), presenting renewable energy as posing significant risks and dangers to the environment."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,' wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This argument directly supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies by blaming them for broad socio-economic hardships (housing unaffordability, high costs of essentials). This specific claim of causing unaffordable housing and living costs is not captured by the more specific subnarratives about energy's danger, cost, unreliability, or nuclear energy."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the domestic economic consequences of green policies (unaffordable housing, energy) as a national security weakness, implying that these policies are a form of geopolitical self-sabotage that leaves the country vulnerable to adversaries, which aligns with the idea of international climate relations being exploitative or abusive to national strength."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'\"",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist' is used pejoratively to characterize the green agenda as serving international or supranational interests at the expense of national (American) interests. This supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments, but the specific argument—that they are driven by a 'globalist' agenda—does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives; it is a distinct argument about the agenda's allegiance and purpose."

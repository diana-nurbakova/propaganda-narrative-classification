      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly questions the effectiveness and catastrophic consequences of the climate policy goal advocated by protesters, framing it as genocidal."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda. As the end of the biblical age of grace approaches, the world is increasingly coming unhinged, including environmentally as the birth pangs intensify. The theory that climate fanatics have adopted...",
      "reasoning": "The text labels climate activists as 'fanatics' and attributes their beliefs to 'propaganda' and a quasi-religious delusion, challenging the movement's motives and integrity."

      "evidence_quote": "even though the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This statement minimizes the significance of human-caused emissions by claiming natural sources are far greater, thereby downplaying the human impact on climate change."

      "reasoning": "The text cites a claim that there is 'no science' supporting the phase-out of fossil fuels, directly raising doubts about the scientific consensus underpinning climate policy."

      "evidence_quote": "Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "The text vividly amplifies fears about the consequences of implementing climate policies, predicting apocalyptic societal collapse and mass death on a global scale."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the proposed climate policy (stopping oil use) as leading to catastrophic human death, arguing it would fail to achieve a positive environmental or societal outcome and instead cause immense harm."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "On the very first day of an oil- and gas-free world... all homes, businesses, and other structures that rely on either or both of these for light, heat, fuel, or what have you would no longer function.",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that implementing the climate policy would cause an immediate and total collapse of the energy-dependent economic and social infrastructure, depicting a severe negative economic and societal impact."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by challenging the scientific basis for climate policies, arguing that natural emissions dwarf human contributions. This is a criticism of the policy's rationale but does not fit the definitions of 'ineffective', 'negative economic impact', or 'only for profit'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'fear of \"boiling oceans\"' uses exaggerated, alarmist language to characterize the climate movement's concerns, suggesting they are hyperbolic and not based in reality."

      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda.",
      "reasoning": "The text directly attributes the climate movement's position to 'propaganda,' implying it is driven by deceptive or manipulative information rather than genuine scientific or ethical concerns, aligning with the definition of corruption via ulterior motives."

      "evidence_quote": "If we 'just stop oil' like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die... Six billion deaths are about as genocidal as it gets...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes the climate movement by claiming its proposed actions would lead to catastrophic, genocidal human death tolls. This is a distinct criticism of the movement's goals and consequences but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.'"

      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that natural sources (volcanoes) emit far more greenhouse gases than human activities (cars, cattle), thereby arguing that human activity is not the primary driver of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by citing an authority figure to claim there is no scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, which is a form of downplaying the need for climate action. It does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the scientific consensus by asserting that natural sources (volcanoes) emit more CO2 than human activities, thereby arguing that human-caused greenhouse gases are not the primary driver of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote uses a statement from a COP28 president to claim there is no scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, which serves to discredit the scientific consensus and the actions of the climate science community."

      "reasoning": "The text presents an intense catastrophic scenario where implementing climate protesters' demands would lead to the deaths of billions, framing it as a genocidal outcome and the collapse of civilization."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly references and amplifies specific fears associated with climate change ('global warming', 'boiling oceans destroying the planet'), which supports the parent narrative of amplifying climate fears, but does not fit neatly into the more specific definitions of 'Earth will be uninhabitable soon' or 'Doomsday scenarios for humans' as it is describing the fears activists are trying to avert, not a predicted outcome."

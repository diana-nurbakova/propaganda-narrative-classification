      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage... three climate change radicals stormed the stage.",
      "reasoning": "The text uses pejorative labels like 'radical', 'radicals', and describes their action as a 'stunt', framing the climate activists negatively and challenging their methods and integrity, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The activist group Restore Wetlands claimed responsibility for the act, saying: 'Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.'",
      "reasoning": "The quoted statement from the activist group explicitly emphasizes catastrophic consequences of climate change, specifically 'climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences', which serves to amplify fears about the issue."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Watch: Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane After Storming Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The headline uses the derogatory term 'Eco-Loon' to attack the character and sanity of the activist, which is a direct ad hominem attack on a key figure in the climate movement."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the activists' protest as a criminal act of vandalism, criticizing the movement's methods and supporting the parent narrative, but it does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or a direct 'ad hominem attack on key activists'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote from the activist group presents a catastrophic, large-scale scenario of societal collapse as a direct result of climate change, which aligns with the definition of presenting intense catastrophic scenarios as results of climate change."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition?",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by justifying disruptive activism based on climate fears, but it does not fit neatly into the specific definitions of 'Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'Doomsday scenarios for humans', or 'Whatever we do it is already too late'. It is a distinct argument that leverages climate concern to validate extreme actions."

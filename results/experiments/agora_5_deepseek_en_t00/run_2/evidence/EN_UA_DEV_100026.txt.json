    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock",
      "reasoning": "The quote attributes Germany's economic and energy crisis to the war and the Western sanctions regime, rather than to Russia's decision to invade Ukraine. It frames the sanctions as a primary cause of the problem, shifting blame away from the invader."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet... Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly highlights severe negative economic outcomes (high electricity prices, inflation) for Germany and other European nations as a direct consequence of the disruption of Russian gas, which is linked to the sanctions regime and the war."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity... But all of this was forsaken in the quixotic pursuit of a utopian vision of zero-carbon green energy.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the energy and climate policies of the German (and by extension, Western) leadership as foolish, self-destructive, and driven by unrealistic ideology, directly discrediting Western policy decisions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly identifies the Western sanctions regime as a primary cause of Germany's energy crisis, shifting the responsibility for the economic hardship away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and onto the actions of the United States and the West."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The entire article frames Germany's economic crisis as a consequence of its own 'green fanaticism' and the West's sanctions, with the war itself presented merely as the context that triggered these policies, not as the root cause of the problem.",
      "reasoning": "The text supports the parent narrative by consistently blaming Germany's economic woes on its domestic energy policies and the Western sanctions response to the war, rather than on Russia's act of invasion. This overarching argument, while linked to the 'West as aggressors' subnarrative, is a broader application of the parent narrative that merits the 'Other' classification as a distinct, supporting theme."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes Germany's energy crisis and high costs to the Western sanctions regime against Russia, framing the sanctions as a self-inflicted wound that forces Germany into a desperate and expensive scramble for alternatives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This statement generalizes the negative consequences of the conflict and the sanctions beyond Germany, arguing that the West (specifically European nations) is suffering from higher inflation and energy costs as a direct result of the disruption to Russian gas supplies, which supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a division within Europe, specifically between nations that were heavily reliant on Russian gas and those that were not, suggesting the EU is not a unified bloc with shared interests or outcomes, which aligns with presenting the EU as divided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This statement presents a core Western European power, Germany, as economically crippled and failing due to its own policies, which implicitly supports the narrative of Western weakness and decline."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock...",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the Western sanctions regime as a direct cause of Germany's severe energy and economic crisis, portraying the West's response to the war as a self-destructive overreaction that harms its own member states more than it helps."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error.",
      "reasoning": "This implies that the sacrifices Germany is making (implicitly linked to supporting Ukraine via sanctions and energy policy) are pointless and driven by ideological virtue-signaling rather than a genuine concern for Ukraine's fate, suggesting the West's actions are for its own perceived moral/image benefits, not for Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity derived from world-class coal and nuclear power.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western (specifically German) policy as foolish and self-harming, but it does not cleanly fit any of the more specific diplomatic subnarratives like division, weakness, overreaction, or lack of care for Ukraine. It is a broader argument about Western incompetence and self-destruction."

      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions Russia's invasion as a cause, but also includes 'the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych' as a contributing factor to Ukraine's financial crisis. This fits the narrative of shifting some blame for negative outcomes (Ukraine's economic troubles) onto a Ukrainian actor, alongside the primary invader."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly evokes fear by predicting specific, catastrophic consequences for Western European capitals (Amsterdam, Warsaw, Berlin, Prague) if Ukraine does not receive sufficient support. This is designed to elicit anxiety about the war spreading and directly threatening the West."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The war's toll on Ukraine’s public finances is extremely detrimental. The national debt has already exceeded 90% of GDP and continues to grow. Almost 70% of all international financial assistance to Ukraine comes as loans, with interest to be paid by the state.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the financial burden of the war as being exacerbated by the nature of Western aid (primarily loans with interest), implicitly shifting responsibility for Ukraine's economic hardship onto the Western partners' terms of assistance, rather than focusing on Russia's role as the invader causing the devastation."

      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This statement attributes the 2015 crisis partly to the policies of a former Ukrainian president, blending the cause of Russia's invasion with internal Ukrainian governance failures. This supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by introducing a domestic actor (Yanukovych) as a contributing factor to the economic consequences of the conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly warns that if Ukraine does not prevail, the Russian military threat will extend to other European countries, specifically naming cities in NATO member states, which matches the definition of evoking fear of imminent attack on other countries."

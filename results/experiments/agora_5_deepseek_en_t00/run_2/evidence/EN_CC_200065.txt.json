      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the scientific basis of the claims about historical temperatures by pointing to the limited timeframe of direct data collection, casting doubt on the methods used to establish long-term records."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses a NASA statement to highlight a methodological distinction between proxy and instrumental data, implicitly questioning the validity of combining them to make claims about 'thousands of years,' thereby sowing doubt about the scientific conclusions."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather",
      "reasoning": "The term 'alarmists' is a pejorative label that challenges the motives and credibility of those raising climate concerns, framing them as irrational or exaggerating, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing the climate movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert...",
      "reasoning": "Describing the claims as 'extravagant' directly challenges the integrity and factual basis of the climate movement's communications, questioning their motives and the seriousness of their warnings."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question sarcastically implies that the narrative of extreme heat is more about creating a compelling 'story' than about scientific fact, thereby minimizing the significance and validity of the reported climate change impacts."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the reliability of the paleoclimate data (proxy records) used to make claims about temperatures thousands of years ago, framing them as fundamentally different and incompatible with modern instrumental records."

      "reasoning": "The text dismisses the scientific claims as 'extravagant' and uses skeptical language ('likely', emphasis added) to question their validity. This supports the parent narrative of questioning the science but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about data, methodology, or the scientific community's reliability; it is a general expression of skepticism towards the conclusions."

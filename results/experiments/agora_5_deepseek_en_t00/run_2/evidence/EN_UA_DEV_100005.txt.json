      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly questions the reliability and framing of Western media coverage, accusing it of prolonging the war, which fits the 'Distrust towards Media' narrative."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly evokes fear and fatalistic acceptance of nuclear war, which is a core example of amplifying war-related fears and the threat of catastrophic escalation."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "we deserve EVERYTHING we get",
      "reasoning": "This statement, in the context of the preceding text blaming un-elected bureaucrats and Western governments, implies that Western populations will face severe negative consequences (deserved punishment) for their leaders' actions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "amerika always blew any comment about RUSSIA or at later stages CHINA way out of proportion.. and you are still doing",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses the West (specifically the US) of consistently and disproportionately exaggerating threats from Russia and China, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West's reaction as disproportionate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death. The question is, why the desperation to keep the war going?",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the Western media's framing is deliberately prolonging the war for its own reasons, suggesting the West's actions are not for Ukraine's benefit but serve other, undisclosed interests that lead to more Ukrainian death."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations",
      "reasoning": "The statement suggests that the current approach (influenced by Western media) is preventing successful negotiations from concluding, thereby discrediting the potential of ongoing diplomatic efforts."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "amerikans are the greatest pigs on the planet…and that is in the most derogitive term you can imagine.. absolute pigs",
      "reasoning": "This is a broad, vitriolic attack on the moral character and value of Americans (representing the West), which supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West but does not fit neatly into any of the more specific diplomatic subnarratives provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "Another must listen to interview with information that you are missing from the corporation propaganda western media",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly labels Western media as 'corporation propaganda,' framing it as a tool that withholds or distorts information, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Western media institutions as instruments of propaganda."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by accusing Western media of a specific, harmful framing of the war that has real-world consequences. It discredits Western media's reporting but does not fit the more specific definitions of being an 'instrument of propaganda' or targeting Ukrainian media, thus it is a remainder supporting the parent narrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear and anxiety about the use of nuclear weapons, framing a full nuclear war as a plausible and imminent outcome, which aligns with the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The question is, why the desperation to keep the war going? Will they resort to nuclear weapons to even out the war?",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by posing rhetorical questions that suggest desperation and a potential resort to extreme measures (nuclear weapons), but the specific fear evoked is about the motives and actions of an unspecified 'they' (likely Western leadership) to prolong conflict, which is not captured by the other specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "for the west it’s always been the soviet (RUSSIAN) that has ALWAYS been the boogie man..when in fact they were SELDOM a threat.. amerika always blew any comment about RUSSIA or at later stages CHINA way out of proportion.. and you are still doing",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that Western (specifically American) demonization and overreaction towards Russia is a persistent, misguided policy. It implies that this aggressive posture, which includes sanctions and confrontation, is based on a false premise ('SELDOM a threat') and is therefore a self-inflicted negative consequence for the West, aligning with the idea that such policies are counterproductive and backfire."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "thanks mostly to un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries” they are proving the worst of the worst of humanity",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly attributes negative consequences (the implied path to nuclear war and societal collapse) to the actions of Western governments and their unelected officials. It supports the parent narrative by blaming Western political structures for creating a catastrophic situation, which is a negative consequence for the West itself, but does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

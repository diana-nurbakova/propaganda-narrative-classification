      "reasoning": "This series of quotes outlines a list of severe demands and consequences for the West, including the dissolution of NATO, reparations, and territorial claims, predicting a future where the West is subjugated and pays a heavy price."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "“We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself... The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.” The host chimed in to ask: “Are you including Alaska and Fort Ross?” Matveychev nodded: “That was my next point. As well as the Antarctic... We discovered it, so it belongs to us...",

      "evidence_quote": "She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.” Russian state media and government officials have taken to describing any opponents of the Kremlin in Ukraine as or “Banderites,” the followers of Stepan Bandera, the ultranationalist political figure who fought for Ukrainian independence before being assassinated by the KGB in 1959. This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly labels Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites,' a term used to associate them with historical ultranationalist figures and, by extension, Nazi ideology, which aligns with the subnarrative of associating Ukraine with nazism."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko [former deputy minister at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs], Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko.",
      "reasoning": "The call for the extradition of current and former Ukrainian officials as 'war criminals' directly seeks to delegitimize and criminalize the Ukrainian government and its leadership."

      "evidence_quote": "“There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote, while criticizing the US, implies a broader global perspective where Russia is not isolated and can perceive and exploit the weaknesses of other nations, indirectly suggesting a position of strength and awareness on the international stage."

      "evidence_quote": "“We can take them down without it.” (in response to a question about using nuclear strikes)",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as supremely confident and militarily capable enough to defeat its adversaries ('take them down') without resorting to its ultimate weapons, which is a form of praise for Russian strength and strategic superiority not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Multiple state TV shows emphasized the reluctance on the part of the United States and NATO to intervene against Russia’s bloody invasion of its neighbor, presenting it as the proof that the Kremlin can go to any lengths to emerge victorious.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the West (U.S. and NATO) as unwilling and therefore weak, unable or unwilling to stop Russian actions, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as a non-potent group."

      "evidence_quote": "She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the American public is indifferent to Ukraine's fate, suggesting Western support is not driven by genuine care for Ukraine but by other, presumably self-serving, concerns."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "Olga Skabeeva, the host of a state TV show 60 Minutes, intentionally distorted the statements of White House press secretary Jen Psaki. On Friday, Skabeeva claimed: “Jennifer Psaki’s statement said that no matter what Putin does in Ukraine—whether he uses biological weapons or drops a nuclear bomb—the United States won’t get involved.”",
      "reasoning": "By fabricating a claim that the U.S. stated it would not intervene even against extreme Russian actions (nuclear/bio weapons), the narrative implies that Western concerns and reactions to Russia's actual invasion are disproportionate and alarmist, fitting the 'overreacting' subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "\"According to top Kremlin propagandists, it’s only a matter of time before the West admits its defeat and pays reparations to Moscow or risks a devastating nuclear strike.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by presenting a catastrophic negative consequence for the West (defeat, reparations, or nuclear devastation) but does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows; it is a broader threat of geopolitical and military defeat."

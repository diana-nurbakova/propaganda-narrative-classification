      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia, the invader, and onto the West, accusing it of vetoing a peace agreement."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,”",
      "reasoning": "The statement criticizes Western (European) policy, portraying it as a malicious proxy war driven by American interests that harms Europe and Ukraine, thereby discrediting Western diplomatic and military actions."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "“We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear by predicting a catastrophic, violent retaliation ('level Western Europe to the ground') from a united Slavic bloc if Western support for Ukraine continues, amplifying fears of a wider conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the continuation of the war away from Russia and onto the West, accusing Western powers of blocking a peace deal and thereby prolonging the conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,”",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the war as an American proxy conflict, with the West (specifically the EU) as the aggressor intentionally fueling the war to harm Russia, rather than Russia being the invading party."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a “US problem.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly labels the conflict as a 'US problem,' shifting the origin and primary responsibility for the war away from Russia and onto the United States."

      "evidence_quote": "“We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West for the war's violence ('supporting the killing of Slavs') and framing Western support as the cause of a potential broader Slavic retaliation, but it does not fit neatly into the 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as it introduces a distinct ethno-nationalist threat narrative."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Members of the European Parliament (EP) engaged in mutual insults during debates on the need for further support to Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the EU as a divided entity, showing internal conflict and lack of unity on a key policy issue (support for Ukraine), which aligns with the definition of presenting the EU as a set of divided entities and interests."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "“And you have the audacity to claim that this is assistance to Ukraine. The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that Western support is not genuinely for Ukraine's benefit but serves the selfish interests (profits) of Western arms manufacturers, directly matching the definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote discredits past diplomatic efforts (a peace agreement) by blaming the West for vetoing it, implying that diplomacy was sabotaged and, by extension, that current or future diplomatic efforts are undermined or futile."

      "evidence_quote": "“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,”",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by framing the conflict as a cynical American 'proxy war' pursued to damage Russia, which is a distinct argument not covered by the other specific subnarratives. It portrays Western motives as aggressive and destructive rather than weak, divided, or disinterested."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII",
      "evidence_quote": "“We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a catastrophic escalation, warning that continued Western support for Ukraine will provoke a unified Slavic (implied Russian-led) retaliation that will destroy Western Europe, aligning with the subnarrative of warning against actions that upset Russia and risk a wider world war."

      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,”",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by amplifying fears related to the war's continuation, specifically by claiming the West deliberately prolonged the conflict by blocking peace. It fosters anxiety about the war's avoidable nature and the consequences of continued involvement, but does not fit the specific definitions of nuclear use, NATO intervention, or Russia attacking other countries."

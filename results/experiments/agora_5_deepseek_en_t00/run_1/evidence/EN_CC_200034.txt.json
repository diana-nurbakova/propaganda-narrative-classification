      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly questions the effectiveness and catastrophic consequences of the climate policy advocated by the Just Stop Oil movement, framing it as genocidal."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The theory that climate fanatics have adopted as to why this is all happening blames human activity and industry... Even so, member of groups like Just Stop Oil have been deluded – or perhaps deluded themselves – into believing that they must appease the climate gods",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the motives and intellectual integrity of the climate movement, labeling them as 'fanatics' and 'deluded,' and characterizing their beliefs as a quasi-religious appeasement of 'climate gods.'"

      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This statement minimizes the significance of human-caused climate change by arguing that natural sources like volcanoes emit more greenhouse gases, thereby downplaying the impact of human activity."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "The text cites a claim that there is 'no science' supporting the phase-out of fossil fuels, directly raising doubts about the scientific consensus underpinning climate policy."

      "evidence_quote": "Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "The text vividly amplifies fears about the consequences of implementing climate policies, predicting a catastrophic, immediate collapse of society and mass death on a global scale."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that implementing the climate policy (stopping oil use) would fail to achieve its intended environmental goal of saving the planet and instead lead to catastrophic human death, framing the policy as fundamentally ineffective and counterproductive."

      "evidence_quote": "On the very first day of an oil- and gas-free world... all homes, businesses, and other structures that rely on either or both of these for light, heat, fuel, or what have you would no longer function.",
      "reasoning": "This quote describes a scenario where the cessation of fossil fuel use would cause the immediate collapse of essential infrastructure for homes and businesses, depicting a severe negative economic and societal impact from the proposed climate policy."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by challenging the scientific basis for climate policies, arguing that natural emissions dwarf human contributions. This is a criticism of the rationale behind the policies but does not fit the definitions of 'ineffective', 'negative economic impact', or 'only for profit'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'fear of \"boiling oceans\"' uses exaggerated, alarmist language to characterize the climate movement's concerns, suggesting they are hyperbolic and not based in reality."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda.",

      "evidence_quote": "member of groups like Just Stop Oil have been deluded – or perhaps deluded themselves",

      "evidence_quote": "If we 'just stop oil' like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "This core argument criticizes the climate movement by presenting an extreme, catastrophic consequence of its proposed policy, which is a distinct form of criticism not covered by the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that natural sources (volcanoes) emit far more greenhouse gases than human activities (cars, cattle), thereby arguing that human activities are not the primary driver of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by citing an authority figure to dismiss the scientific basis for climate action (phasing out fossil fuels), which downplays the urgency and validity of climate change concerns. It does not fit any of the other specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the scientific consensus that human emissions are the primary driver of climate change by asserting that natural sources like volcanoes emit far more CO2, thereby questioning the causal link between human activity and climate change."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Scientific community is unreliable",
      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses the statement of a COP28 president to claim there is 'no science' supporting a key climate policy, thereby discrediting the scientific basis and reliability of the broader scientific community's recommendations."

      "evidence_quote": "Do you believe the planet is melting or boiling due to man-made climate change? Learn more about why this is not the case at Climate.news.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly questions the reality of man-made climate change ('melting or boiling') and directs readers to a source (Climate.news) that purportedly debunks it. It supports the parent narrative of questioning climate science but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about methodologies, data, greenhouse effect, or the scientific community's reliability."

      "evidence_quote": "Six billion people is a lot of people. Six billion deaths are about as genocidal as it gets... Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "The text presents an intense catastrophic scenario where implementing climate action (stopping oil) would directly lead to the deaths of billions, framing it as a genocidal outcome. This matches the definition of presenting catastrophic scenarios as results of climate-related actions."

      "reasoning": "This quote references and mocks the fears of 'global warming' and 'boiling oceans' as irrational beliefs held by climate activists. It amplifies climate fears by presenting them as exaggerated and unscientific, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of 'Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'Amplifying existing fears...', 'Doomsday scenarios...', or 'Whatever we do it is already too late'."

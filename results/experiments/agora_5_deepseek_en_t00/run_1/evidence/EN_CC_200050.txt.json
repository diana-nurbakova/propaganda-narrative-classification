      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Both U.S.-based bank Citi and German Deutsche Bank announced plans to reduce investments in coal this week, the latest step in the movement amongst major banks to reduce their funding of fossil fuels and other industries that produce greenhouse gasses.",
      "reasoning": "The headline and opening paragraph frame the banks' climate-related investment decisions as 'bending the knee to climate activists,' which implicitly criticizes the policies and actions as being driven by activist pressure rather than sound economic or environmental reasoning."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Both banks are founding members of the United Nations’ Net Zero Banking Alliance, which requires its 126 members to set goals and disclose financial data related to their efforts to reduce the emissions of their lending portfolio to net zero by 2050.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the role of the United Nations' alliance in setting requirements for banks, suggesting that global environmental frameworks are being used to exert influence and control over financial institutions and their investment portfolios, framing it as a tool of broader geopolitical power."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF. The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the banks' climate-related actions primarily as financial investment decisions ('investing $0.81... for every $1'), suggesting the shift is driven by profit-seeking in a growing 'green energy' market rather than by purely environmental or policy motives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline's phrasing 'Bend The Knee To Climate Activists' frames climate policy actions as a form of coerced submission to a specific activist group, which criticizes the policies by portraying them as undemocratic or driven by pressure rather than sound reasoning. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the global push for green energy as potentially exploitative, highlighting how developing nations lack the resources and infrastructure to comply with the rapid shift demanded by international climate alliances and policies, thereby positioning these policies as economically abusive to less developed countries."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The statement implies that the pressure from developed nations and international alliances (like the UN Net Zero Banking Alliance) for a rapid transition to renewables exerts control over developing nations, which are depicted as lacking autonomy and capacity, echoing neo-colonial dynamics where external powers dictate economic and energy policies."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios, Bloomberg reported in January. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This describes green policies (via banking alliances and activist pressure) being used as a geopolitical or socio-economic instrument to enforce compliance through financial coercion (threatening to pull funds), which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives as defined."

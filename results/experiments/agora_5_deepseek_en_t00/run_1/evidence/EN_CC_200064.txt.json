      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage during Sweden’s Strictly Come Dancing final over the weekend.",
      "reasoning": "The terms 'radical climate activist' and the description of the activist being physically knocked down frames the climate movement in a negative, disruptive, and potentially deserving of ridicule light, challenging its integrity and methods."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "three climate change radicals stormed the stage.",
      "reasoning": "Labeling the activists as 'radicals' and describing their action as 'stormed the stage' portrays the climate movement as extreme and aggressive, criticizing its tactics and public impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, attributed to the activist group, directly emphasizes catastrophic and existential threats from climate change, which aligns with the narrative of amplifying fears about its consequences."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Watch: Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane After Storming Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The term 'Eco-Loon' is a derogatory and insulting label directed at the activist, attacking their character and sanity rather than engaging with their message, which fits the definition of an ad hominem attack on activists."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the activists' protest as a criminal act of vandalism, criticizing the movement's methods and portraying them as lawbreakers. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of being alarmist, corrupt, or solely an ad hominem attack."

      "evidence_quote": "Watch: Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane After Storming Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The term 'Eco-Loon' is a derogatory and dismissive label attacking the character and sanity of the activists, fitting the definition of an ad hominem attack on key activists."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the activists' protest as a criminal act of vandalism, which criticizes the movement's methods and supports the parent narrative, but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or a direct ad hominem attack on a key figure's reputation."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This direct quote from the activist group presents an intense catastrophic scenario for humanity as a result of climate change, framing it as a global threat leading to societal collapse."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The activists' statement justifies disruptive action by invoking a climate threat, which supports the parent narrative of amplifying climate fears. However, the specific argument that extreme disruption is justified due to the severity of the threat does not neatly fit the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

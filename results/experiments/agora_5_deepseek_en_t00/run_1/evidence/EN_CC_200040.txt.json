      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "After multiple instances of vandalism against famous landmarks and artistic works of western cultural significance, many people are growing annoyed with the actions of climate alarmists.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the actions and methods of climate activists, framing them as 'alarmists' whose vandalism is causing public annoyance, which aligns with the narrative of challenging the motives, integrity, or impact of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly criticizes the climate movement's public relations strategy, suggesting its actions are counterproductive and damaging to its own cause, which fits the definition of challenging the impact and motives of the movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical '(it's not)' directly dismisses the premise that human-caused climate change is a legitimate threat, which is a clear statement minimizing the significance of climate change."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase suggests that concerns about global warming are exaggerated ('exploited') and that its predicted severe consequences do not come to pass ('never seem to materialize'), thereby downplaying the reality and impact of climate change."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Less than half of Americans believe climate change is caused by human activity.",
      "reasoning": "By citing polling data on public belief, the text implicitly questions the scientific consensus that climate change is primarily caused by human activity, raising doubt about the established science."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "global warming predictions that never seem to materialize",

      "evidence_quote": "The most hated group in America (climate protestors)",
      "reasoning": "This is a direct, reputation-based attack on climate protesters as a collective, labeling them as widely despised, which fits the definition of ad hominem attacks on key figures within the movement."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Their defacement of Stonehenge could be considered relatively successful because no one was able to stop them. It's impossible to understand the logic behind the focus on an ancient site... However, climate activists seem to be more concerned with media coverage than making sense.",
      "reasoning": "This criticizes the movement's tactics as illogical, counterproductive, and focused on sensationalism over substance. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks' as defined."

      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda",
      "reasoning": "Labeling climate communication as 'propaganda' funded by 'billions of dollars' implies the movement is driven by financial motives and deceptive messaging, suggesting corruption or unethical influence."

      "evidence_quote": "The most hated group in America (climate protestors)",
      "reasoning": "These quotes attack the character and motives of climate protesters as a group, labeling them 'phony' and 'the most hated,' which constitutes an ad hominem attack on key activists rather than engaging with their arguments."

      "reasoning": "This criticizes the strategic competence of the climate movement, suggesting their actions are counterproductive and alienating the public. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

      "reasoning": "This statement attacks the priorities and logic of the movement, accusing it of valuing sensationalism over coherent argument. This is a criticism of the movement's methods and rationale, which supports the parent narrative but is not captured by the specific subnarratives provided."

      "reasoning": "This phrase frames mainstream climate concern as 'hysteria' and 'propaganda,' which is a general strategy to downplay the significance and validity of climate change. It supports the parent narrative but does not align with the more specific, science-focused definitions of the other subnarratives (e.g., natural cycles, CO2 impact, sea levels)."

      "evidence_quote": "global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly asserts that the predicted outcomes of climate science (global warming) are not occurring, which aligns with the subnarrative that data does not support claims of temperature increase."

      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly rejects the core scientific consensus that human activity drives climate change, supporting the parent narrative of questioning climate science. It does not fit the specific definitions about methodologies, data showing no increase, or the scientific community's reliability, but is a direct denial of the science."

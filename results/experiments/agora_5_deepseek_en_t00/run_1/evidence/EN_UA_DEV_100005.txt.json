      "reasoning": "This direct quote is a severe and derogatory criticism of Western (specifically American) society, attacking its moral character and legitimacy, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting the West."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly accuses Western media of misrepresenting the war's progress ('framing'), implying it is unreliable propaganda that prolongs conflict, directly undermining confidence in media sources."
    },

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly invokes the fear of a full-scale nuclear war and the annihilation of populations, which is designed to elicit extreme anxiety about severe consequences and potential escalation."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "we deserve EVERYTHING we get",
      "reasoning": "This statement, in the context of the preceding text blaming Western governments and bureaucrats, implies that Western populations will face severe negative outcomes as a consequence of their leaders' actions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "amerika always blew any comment about RUSSIA or at later stages CHINA way out of proportion.. and you are still doing",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses the West (specifically America) of consistently and disproportionately exaggerating threats from Russia and China, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West's reaction as disproportionate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death. The question is, why the desperation to keep the war going?",
      "reasoning": "This implies that the West, through its media framing, is deliberately prolonging the war in Ukraine for its own reasons (e.g., to weaken Russia), showing a disregard for Ukrainian lives and prioritizing Western strategic interests."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "amerikans are the greatest pigs on the planet…and that is in the most derogitive term you can imagine.. absolute pigs",
      "reasoning": "This is a broad, vitriolic attack on the moral character of Americans (representing the West) that supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West but does not fit any of the more specific diplomatic or strategic subnarratives provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "Another must listen to interview with information that you are missing from the corporation propaganda western media",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly labels Western media as 'corporation propaganda,' framing it as a tool that withholds or distorts information, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Western media institutions as instruments of propaganda."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by accusing Western media of a specific harmful framing ('as if Russia is losing') that has negative consequences. It discredits Western media's reporting but does not fit the more specific definitions of being an 'instrument of propaganda' or targeting Ukrainian media; it is a distinct argument about misleading framing causing harm."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "Will they resort to nuclear weapons to even out the war?",
      "reasoning": "This direct question explicitly raises the possibility of nuclear weapon use in the context of the Ukraine war, evoking fear about that specific outcome."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by presenting a catastrophic, world-ending nuclear war as a seemingly inevitable or even desirable outcome to end suffering, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the more specific definitions about WW3, attacking other countries, or NATO intervention."

      "evidence_quote": "for the west it’s always been the soviet (RUSSIAN) that has ALWAYS been the boogie man..when in fact they were SELDOM a threat.. amerika always blew any comment about RUSSIA or at later stages CHINA way out of proportion.. and you are still doing",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that Western (specifically American) portrayal and policy towards Russia is an overreaction and misrepresentation, implying that the West's confrontational stance is based on a false premise and is therefore self-defeating or counterproductive, aligning with the idea that Western actions (like sanctions or hostility) will have negative consequences for the West itself."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly and no more of month after month of promises from Trump or threats from the east….POOF..it’s all over …thanks mostly to un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries” they are proving the worst of the worst of humanity",
      "reasoning": "This quote catastrophizes the potential outcome of the conflict, suggesting a nuclear war that would wipe out populations, and explicitly blames 'un-elected bureaucrats in all \"western countries\"' for leading to this apocalyptic scenario. It supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West by depicting an extreme, existential negative outcome directly resulting from Western political actions and leadership."

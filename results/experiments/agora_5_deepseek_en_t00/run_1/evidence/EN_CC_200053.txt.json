      "reasoning": "This quote frames climate action (attending COP27) as being in potential conflict with domestic economic priorities, implicitly questioning the immediate effectiveness or priority of climate policies when faced with economic challenges."

But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the competence and consistency of the UK government's leadership on climate and energy policy, highlighting reversals and demotions that undermine authority and policy stability."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the government's climate policy approach by highlighting inconsistency and demoting key climate officials, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the UK government's inconsistent and seemingly unserious approach to climate policy, highlighting policy reversals and the demotion of key climate officials, which fits the definition of disapproving of how a national government handles climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "The U-turn comes after Sunak came under pressure from climate activists, opposition parties, and some Conservative MPs including his former boss Boris Johnson and the government’s climate czar Alok Sharma, for his planned absence.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the Prime Minister's initial decision to skip the summit as a failure of leadership and judgment, inviting criticism from various political quarters, thereby discrediting a political figure in the context of the climate debate."

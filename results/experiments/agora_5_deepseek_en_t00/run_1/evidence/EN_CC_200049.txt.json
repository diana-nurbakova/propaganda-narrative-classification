      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the significance of heat-related mortality, a key impact of climate change, by presenting alternative data to minimize its perceived threat relative to cold."

      "evidence_quote": "According to data published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), over the past twenty years annual heat-related deaths in the U.S. have ranged between 0.9 and 3.6 per million people whereas cold-related deaths have ranged between 3.6 and 5.9 per million people.",
      "reasoning": "The text uses selective data from an official agency (EPA) to cast doubt on the scientific assertion that heat-related deaths are a leading weather-related concern, thereby questioning the evidence base for climate change impacts."

      "reasoning": "The term 'Alarmists' in the headline is a pejorative label that challenges the credibility and motives of those raising concerns about climate change, fitting the narrative of criticizing the climate movement."

      "evidence_quote": "According to the Lancet, people around the world are 9.4 times more likely to die from the cold than from the heat. It added that over the past 20 years, the death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that the impact of increased temperatures (global warming) on mortality is minimal and is offset by a larger decrease in cold-related deaths, thereby downplaying the significant negative impact of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "The group’s assertion that in the U.S. most weather-related deaths “are caused by heat” does not stand up to scrutiny, however, since the majority of weather-related deaths come from cold, not heat.",
      "reasoning": "This statement counters a specific claim about the dangers of heat (a consequence of climate change) by presenting alternative data, which serves to undermine the perceived severity and urgency of climate change. This supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the reliability of the claim made by 'alarmists' by presenting alternative data, implying the original assertion is based on faulty or misleading metrics."

      "reasoning": "This quote uses data to suggest that the net effect of warming (a decrease in cold deaths) outweighs the negative effect (increase in heat deaths), indirectly questioning the severity of the temperature increase's impact as presented by climate advocates."

      "evidence_quote": "The UK-based Lancet medical journal, which regularly laments the dire consequences of climate change...",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'regularly laments' frames the journal's stance as biased or overly emotional, casting doubt on the reliability and objectivity of the scientific community it represents."

      "reasoning": "The headline directly labels those warning about the heat dome as 'Alarmists,' framing their claims as exaggerated and sensationalist, which matches the definition of suggesting the climate movement exaggerates severity for dramatic effect."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the factual basis of a climate movement claim, arguing it is incorrect. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.' It is a distinct form of criticism based on disputing data."

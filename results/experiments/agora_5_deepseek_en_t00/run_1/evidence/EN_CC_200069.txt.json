      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the destruction of street zoning barriers as a positive act of resistance, directly challenging the implementation of a specific climate or urban policy (traffic filtering/zoning) and implying it is an overreach or negative policy worth opposing."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' directly challenges the rationale and actions of the climate movement, portraying it as irrational and extreme, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing the movement's motives and impact."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con...",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate change as 'The Climate Con' (short for 'confidence trick' or scam) fundamentally downplays its seriousness and legitimacy, suggesting it is a fabricated or exaggerated issue rather than a genuine crisis."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate policies as irrational and misguided, implying they are not a sensible or effective response to climate issues."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast. Or you can make a donation here.",
      "reasoning": "The text labels climate action as 'The Climate Con', suggesting it is a deceptive scheme. It then solicits financial support from readers to fight it, implying the climate agenda is a fraudulent enterprise driven by profit motives for its proponents, which the audience is urged to financially resist."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "This describes direct, illegal action against a specific climate policy measure (traffic restrictions or LTNs). It supports the parent narrative by showing active, physical rejection of the policies, but the argument is about civil disobedience and reclaiming public space, which does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'madness' frames the climate change movement and its associated policies as irrational and hysterical, which aligns with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist and exaggerating the issue."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate action as 'The Climate Con' (short for 'con game' or 'confidence trick') directly alleges that the climate movement is a fraudulent scheme, implying it is driven by deception and ulterior motives, which matches the definition of corruption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Taking matters into their own hands, Oxford residents are destroying street zoning barriers. Now that’s quite beautiful to see.",
      "reasoning": "This statement celebrates and encourages direct, illegal action against climate-related policies (street zoning/15-minute city concepts). It criticizes the climate movement by endorsing civil disobedience against its implementations, which is a form of criticism not covered by the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate change concerns as irrational or hysterical, which is a form of downplaying its significance and legitimacy, but does not fit any of the more specific scientific or impact-denial subnarratives provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023.",
      "reasoning": "Promoting disobedience against climate policies implicitly downplays the urgency and necessity of those policies, supporting the parent narrative of downplaying climate change through oppositional action, but not matching a specific defined subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con",
      "reasoning": "Labeling climate change as a 'Con' (short for confidence trick or scam) directly dismisses it as a fraudulent concept, which is a core method of downplaying it, but this specific rhetorical framing is not captured by the other subnarrative definitions."

      "reasoning": "This quote questions the economic impact and potential burden of the climate policy (the EV transition mandate) on taxpayers, which aligns with the narrative's definition of criticizing the effectiveness or economic impact of climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This statement introduces skepticism and criticism of the green technology (EV battery plants) by associating its development with foreign geopolitical adversaries, suggesting controversy and negative consequences tied to the technology's implementation."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the green policy (EV transition and associated investments) as being entangled with the geopolitical interests of China, implying the policy is being used or influenced by external power structures rather than being purely for environmental benefit."

      "reasoning": "This quote highlights an unknown financial burden on taxpayers, framing the policy as potentially costly and economically risky, which aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies negatively impact the economy."

      "reasoning": "This quote, and the subsequent discussion of specific Chinese corporate investments, suggests the policy is driven by foreign corporate and political interests rather than genuine environmental benefit, implying profit motives are involved."

      "evidence_quote": "The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the policy by highlighting strong local opposition and political consequences, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "evidence_quote": "The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames the transition to electric vehicles as having an uncertain and potentially significant financial burden on taxpayers, aligning with the subnarrative that green technologies are expensive."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This statement introduces a controversy about green technology (EV/battery production) by associating it with foreign geopolitical risks and unpopular local decisions, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting the specific definitions of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear unfriendliness."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links the state's green energy policy (electrifying the fleet) to investments with Chinese corporations tied to the CCP, framing the policy as a vehicle for foreign (specifically Chinese) influence and control within the state, aligning with the concept of neo-colonialism where external powers exert control through economic initiatives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Gotion Inc., linked to the CCP, plans to build a $2.4 billion EV battery plant in the Big Rapids, Michigan, area at Whitmer’s behest.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by providing a specific example of how the policy (electrification) leads to entanglement with a foreign geopolitical actor (China/CCP). It does not fit the 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions precisely, as it focuses on domestic policy enabling foreign corporate involvement, making it a distinct supporting argument for the broader narrative."

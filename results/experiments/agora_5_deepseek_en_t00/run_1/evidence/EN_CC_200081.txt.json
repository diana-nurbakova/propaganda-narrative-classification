      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the effectiveness and environmental impact of a specific climate policy (wind farm development), framing it as contradictory ('green madness') and highlighting a negative consequence (tree felling)."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement aggregates multiple criticisms (ecological damage, reliance on problematic supply chains) to express skepticism and highlight controversies surrounding wind turbine technology."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "The text links green technology (wind turbines) to dependency on a geopolitical adversary ('Communist China'), suggesting environmental policies create strategic vulnerabilities rather than being purely for environmental benefit."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP)...",
      "reasoning": "The use of politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') challenges the legitimacy and motives of the governing institution (Scottish government/SNP) implementing the climate policies."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses 'supposedly' to cast doubt on the environmental benefit of the wind farms, implying the policy (promoting wind energy) is counterproductive by destroying trees, thus failing to achieve genuine environmental goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "“I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'damage to... business' as a concern raised by communities affected by wind farm development, directly linking the climate policy to negative economic outcomes."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes climate policies (wind energy) by highlighting severe environmental and human costs (pollution, health issues) associated with the supply chain in China. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the definitions of 'ineffective', 'negative economic impact', or 'only for profit'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly links wind turbine production to severe health and environmental dangers from rare earth mineral mining, framing renewable energy as causing significant harm."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "However, responding to the letter, Mr Kerr said: “Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,” adding that the government “must be alive” to the “significant costs” of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'significant costs' associated with wind turbine installation, framing the development as having a high, perhaps unacceptable, price."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the green energy push as hypocritical ('supposedly green') and destructive (cutting down trees), supporting the parent narrative of controversy but not fitting neatly into the specific subnarratives of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy. It introduces a theme of environmental trade-off and hypocrisy distinct from the other categories."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China. The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links Western 'green' wind energy projects to exploitative and harmful mining practices in China, framing the pursuit of green energy as an activity that externalizes severe environmental and health costs onto a developing nation's population, which aligns with the definition of green initiatives as a modern form of colonial control and exploitation."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames a national green policy (wind farm development) as a destructive and hypocritical geopolitical instrument used by a specific government ('leftist Scottish Govt'), suggesting the policy is a tool for political or ideological ends rather than genuine environmental benefit. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' as it focuses on domestic policy hypocrisy and destruction."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the actions and policies of the Scottish national government, portraying its 'green energy' push as hypocritical and destructive, which fits the definition of disapproving of how a national government handles climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The Rural Affairs Secretary for the leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), Mairi Gougeon, has admitted that some 15.7 million trees were cut down...",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') to discredit the SNP and its representative, Mairi Gougeon, in the context of their climate and energy policies, aligning with the definition of discrediting political organizations and figures."

      "reasoning": "This quote, and the article's framing of the government's vow as proceeding despite the criticism, supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities. It is a distinct argument (institutional stubbornness/persisting in a flawed policy) not captured by the more specific subnarratives of criticizing national governments or political figures."

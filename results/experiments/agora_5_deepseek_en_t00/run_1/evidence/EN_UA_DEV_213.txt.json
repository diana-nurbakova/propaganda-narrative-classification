      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly attacks the credibility and motives of Western media, labeling them as 'filthy pro-imperialist' and the source of war talk, fostering distrust."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the conflict and its escalation to the United States and its European allies, portraying them as the deliberate instigators seeking war, which aligns with the definition of blaming the West as the aggressors."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This statement suggests Ukraine, with US backing, is planning a 'false-flag' operation, thereby portraying Ukraine as an active aggressor in the conflict and shifting blame away from Russia."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by blaming the current conflict on the historical dissolution of the USSR and the false promises of peace through integration with the capitalist West, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific 'Ukraine' or 'West' subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses Western governments and media of fabricating and exaggerating the threat of a Russian invasion without evidence, framing their reaction as disproportionate and alarmist."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that Western support for Ukraine is not genuine concern for the country, but rather a 'pretext' for their own geopolitical confrontation with Russia, prioritizing their interests over Ukraine's fate."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted. It writes: 'With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.'",
      "reasoning": "The text cites and endorses the view that the diplomatic window is closing or was never open, presenting diplomatic efforts as futile and implying that the West is not genuinely interested in a negotiated resolution."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western motives, suggesting the escalation is a cynical domestic political ploy rather than a genuine foreign policy. This specific claim—that conflict is sought to distract from domestic crisis—does not fit any of the other defined subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses specific Western media outlets (NYT, WaPo) of leading a disinformation campaign, presenting lies as fact to manipulate public opinion, which aligns with the definition of Western media being an instrument of propaganda."

      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly discredits media across the Atlantic as 'filthy pro-imperialist,' supporting the parent narrative of distrust towards media but not fitting neatly into the specific subnarratives about Western or Ukrainian media alone, as it targets a broader category."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that NATO should take a more direct and aggressive military action (delivering lethal weapons) in the conflict, which aligns with the subnarrative definition of suggesting NATO ought to or will take direct military action."

      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by accusing the US and NATO of deliberately seeking war with Russia, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., WW3, attack on other countries, nuclear weapons, or NATO direct intervention as defined). It evokes a general fear of intentional escalation towards war."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the narrative of an impending Russian invasion as a deliberate, biased fabrication by Western governments and media, suggesting the negative reaction is rooted in a hostile, anti-Russian perspective rather than facts."

      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This quote justifies Russia's posture and potential actions as a necessary and defensive response to NATO's eastward expansion and its intention to incorporate Ukraine, framing Russia as reacting to an external threat."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests Ukraine, with US backing, is planning a false-flag operation, portraying Ukrainian forces as extremist or hostile actors actively working to provoke or justify conflict with Russia."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as a victim of Western/NATO aggression that seeks to undermine its sovereignty and impose humiliating, conqueror-like terms, which does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives."

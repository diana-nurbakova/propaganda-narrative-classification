      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes and delegitimizes NATO, portraying it not as a defensive alliance but as an aggressive tool for American expansion, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Western institutions and diplomacy."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China. So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict... it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "The statement shifts blame for the war's continuation and nature away from Russia (the invader) and onto China and the West, framing the conflict as a Western 'proxy war' and suggesting China is falsely accused of enabling it."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's war effort and government by portraying its mobilization as a callous and desperate act of using its own citizens as 'cannon fodder', which attacks the legitimacy and actions of the Ukrainian state."

      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear by predicting that current actions are leading to a globalized conflict, specifically a 'third world war', which is a classic fear-amplification tactic regarding war consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This highlights a negative outcome for the West (depleting its own arsenals without achieving victory), which fits the narrative of predicting or reporting adverse consequences for Western interests."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly questions the credibility of Western mainstream media and official narratives, framing them as 'nonsense' believed only within a narrow, powerful elite, thus fostering distrust towards these media sources."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly claims the West is willing to prolong the war in Ukraine for its own strategic benefit (expanding to Asia), showing a callous disregard for Ukrainian lives, which are dismissed as expendable 'cannon fodder'."

      "reasoning": "This statement presents the West as militarily ineffective and depleted ('emptying their own weapons warehouses') despite massive investment, and frames its failure to win as a sign of weakness, while shifting blame to China."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying NATO not as a legitimate defensive alliance but as an aggressive, obsolete tool for American expansion. This argument discredits Western diplomatic and security structures but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about division, weakness, overreaction, etc.)."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West for prolonging and expanding the war, and also blames Ukraine ('Kyiv') for its own casualties, which is a form of blaming the war on others that does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as cleanly."

      "reasoning": "This statement broadly discredits the Western narrative about Ukraine, supporting the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by dismissing the information supporting it as 'nonsense' believed only by a deluded Western elite. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a global conflict escalating from the Ukraine war into a third world war, which aligns with the definition of warning against actions that risk WW3."

      "evidence_quote": "Alarmingly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Nato as playing a “bridge” between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific theatres.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames NATO's role as actively connecting and potentially intervening in conflicts across different global theatres, suggesting direct NATO involvement and expansion of its military reach."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western/American actions are leading to catastrophic global consequences, specifically the risk of a third world war, which is a negative consequence for the West and the world, but does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

      "reasoning": "This statement discredits a specific Western media outlet (ABC News) and its interview by framing the US President's claim as a symptom of 'mental decline,' thereby casting doubt on the media's role in presenting credible information and implicitly suggesting it is part of a manipulative system."

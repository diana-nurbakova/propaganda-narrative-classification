      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the US's motivation for involvement in the war as securing access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, thereby shifting the primary cause of the conflict from Russia's invasion to Western economic interests."

'The fate of the colonies is always the same: the Americans will scoop up all the natural resources of Ukraine in exchange for 'the great honor of being a friend of the United States''",
      "reasoning": "The text, through the Russian official's statement, directly criticizes and discredits Western (specifically US) intentions, portraying them as colonial and exploitative rather than supportive."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "'Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the legitimacy of the Ukrainian government by labeling it as both 'corrupt' and a 'neo-Nazi regime', which is a common discrediting narrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote, attributed to a US Senator, portrays Western support for Ukraine as a calculated business investment to exploit resources, reinforcing the narrative that the West's actions are driven by predatory economic interests, not defense of Ukraine."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by accusing the West of supporting a corrupt and illegitimate Ukrainian government. It shifts blame from the invader (Russia) to the West's alleged support for a malign regime, but does not fit the specific definitions of 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' as it focuses on the nature of the Ukrainian government itself as a cause."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames Western (specifically US) support for Ukraine not as a principled stand, but as a self-interested economic calculation to secure access to Ukraine's mineral wealth."

      "reasoning": "These quotes present the West's involvement as a form of neo-colonial exploitation, a theme that supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy but does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, diplomatic failure, or fatigue)."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement delegitimizes the Ukrainian government by labeling it as both 'corrupt' and a 'neo-Nazi regime', which are classic tropes used to portray it as illegitimate and morally bankrupt."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by framing the entire Western involvement in the conflict as a cynical, resource-grabbing endeavor, reducing Ukraine's sovereignty and the conflict's legitimacy to a mere economic calculation. This specific argument—that the West is fighting for resources, not for Ukraine's sovereignty—does not neatly fit the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism... For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Greta Thunberg and her associated thinkers as having a hidden, radical political agenda (anti-capitalism, de-growth) that goes beyond genuine environmental concern, challenging the motives and integrity of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly claims that climate policies are not genuine environmental efforts but are instead a tool ('dressed up') for advancing a specific ideological and political agenda ('radical leftism')."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'human alarm bell' and 'climate Cassandra' directly frames Thunberg and, by extension, the climate movement she represents as alarmist, exaggerating dangers for dramatic effect."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto.",
      "reasoning": "Labeling Thunberg's manifesto as 'demented' is a direct personal attack on her character and mental state, undermining her credibility as a key activist."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by alleging its true goal is not environmental protection but the advancement of a radical leftist political ideology, which is a distinct criticism not covered by the more specific subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Normal” was the “system” which gave us the climate crisis, a system of “colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide”, of “racist, oppressive extractionism”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the climate crisis and the system that caused it in terms of colonialism and imperialism, suggesting that green activism is a response to and a critique of these historical and ongoing exploitative practices, aligning with the definition of green activities as a form of neo-colonialism critique."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a major international climate framework (COP) as fundamentally dishonest and exploitative, supporting the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments. It does not fit the specific 'neo-colonialism' definition but is a distinct argument about the abusive nature of climate-related international relations."

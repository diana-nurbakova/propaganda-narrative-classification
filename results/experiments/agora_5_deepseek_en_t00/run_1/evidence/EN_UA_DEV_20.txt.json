      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto Western nations (the UK and US), framing them as the primary obstacle to a peace deal that Russia allegedly offered."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine. As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "This passage undermines Ukraine's military and governmental effectiveness by highlighting desperate and potentially unpopular conscription measures, portraying the state as failing and its military as depleted and aging, which attacks the competence and sustainability of the Ukrainian war effort."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Western (and Ukrainian) policy as reckless and counterproductive, framing their actions as escalatory provocations that lack strategic value, which aligns with discrediting Western diplomatic and military judgment."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear by suggesting that current Western-supported actions are moving the world toward a 'catastrophic nuclear accident,' amplifying anxieties about severe, existential consequences from the conflict's escalation."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by accusing Ukraine and its Western allies of choosing escalation and provocation over negotiation, thereby prolonging the conflict. It does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' subnarrative, as it frames Ukraine's actions as misguided provocations rather than initial aggression, and it is a distinct argument from the specific claim about the West sabotaging a peace deal."

      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by highlighting the failure of a major military operation and net territorial loss."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This statement delegitimizes the Ukrainian government's decision-making, portraying it as incompetent and easily manipulated by foreign powers, leading to a catastrophic war for its people."

      "reasoning": "This claim explicitly frames Ukraine's decision to continue fighting as being directed by Western powers (the UK and US), supporting the narrative that Ukraine is not an independent actor."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv.",
      "reasoning": "This portrays Ukraine's military situation as having no viable path to victory, emphasizing a lack of manpower and an inability to achieve its stated goals, which frames the future as hopeless."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by portraying its government and its Western allies as reckless and irresponsible, prolonging suffering for no strategic gain. This specific argument—accusing Ukraine of pointless escalation—does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly contrasts Russia's strong, boosted military production with the West's comparatively weaker output, presenting the West as non-potent and unable to match Russia's war effort."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims Western powers (UK and US) persuaded Ukraine to reject a peace deal and continue fighting, implying they prioritized a prolonged conflict (potentially to weaken Russia) over Ukraine's immediate peace and territorial restoration."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Western-backed actions as reckless, escalatory, and strategically unsound, which discredits Western diplomatic and military judgment. This specific argument—that the West is engaging in pointless provocations—does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "The quote warns against pursuing a large-scale offensive against Russia, framing it as a dangerous fantasy that could lead to a major escalation, implicitly evoking the fear of a world war if the conflict is not resolved diplomatically."

      "reasoning": "This describes specific Russian military actions (nuclear drills, naval deployments) that amplify fears of a widening and more dangerous conflict, supporting the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears but not fitting neatly into the other specific subnarrative definitions provided."

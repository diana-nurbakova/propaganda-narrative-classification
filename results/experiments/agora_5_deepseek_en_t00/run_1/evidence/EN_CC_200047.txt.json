      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policies (specifically rationing plans) as tyrannical and questions their true motive by using the word 'allegedly,' which directly aligns with the narrative of criticizing the effectiveness, impact, and motives behind climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "This statement challenges the integrity and intentions of both the 'American elites' and the WEF by labeling their policies as 'tyrannical' and placing 'climate' in scare quotes, questioning their genuine concern and competence."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The text presents the WEF's 'Net Zero' agenda as a plan by a powerful, elite group (the WEF and wealthy citizens) to impose restrictive policies on the general public, suggesting a hidden or coercive scheme under the guise of climate action."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "The report includes polling data regarding support for policies designed to force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda' implies that these environmental policies are tools used by a powerful international organization (the WEF) to exert control and influence, aligning with the narrative that green policies serve as geopolitical instruments rather than purely environmental goals."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The use of scare quotes around 'climate' and the descriptor 'tyrannical' frames the policies as illegitimate and not genuinely aimed at solving an environmental problem, implying they are ineffective in their stated purpose."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "According to a report from the Committee to Unleash Prosperity (CUP), America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The plan to ration essential goods like gas, electricity, and food (meat/dairy) is presented as a direct restriction on consumption and access, which would negatively impact economic activity, household budgets, and quality of life, aligning with the subnarrative of negative economic impact."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Reporting on the story, The College Fix writes that the “Committee to Unleash Prosperity [CUP], in a survey that sought to measure the beliefs of ‘elites,’ stated the findings reveal climate change ‘is clearly an obsession of the very rich and highly educated.’”",
      "reasoning": "This frames climate change concern and the push for restrictive policies as an 'obsession' of a wealthy, out-of-touch elite class, suggesting the agenda serves their interests or worldview rather than being a genuine, public-spirited effort, which aligns with the 'only for profit' or elite class interest subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This argument connects support for climate policies (rationing) to a broader desire to restrict personal freedom and liberty, which is a criticism of the policies' societal impact but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, by labeling its climate policies as 'tyrannical,' which aligns with the definition of disapproving of the role and influence of international entities on climate policy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Astonishingly, the polling shows that almost 90 percent of “American elites” believe strict rationing of gas, meat, and electricity is necessary to combat the so-called “climate crisis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes 'American elites,' a group that includes influential political and organizational figures, by portraying their beliefs as extreme and out of touch, which discredits them in the context of the climate change debate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the attitudes of elites regarding liberty, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about the EU, international entities, national governments, or political organizations. It is a distinct, leftover criticism of elite perspectives."

      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes the push for restrictive climate policies to a specific, powerful global elite group (the WEF) and a domestic elite class that supports them, framing the agenda as 'tyrannical' and imposed from above."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives",
      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The use of 'allegedly' casts doubt on the stated motive of fighting climate change, implying the rationing plan serves a different, unstated purpose, such as controlling the public or reducing their quality of life under a false pretext."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the WEF's climate agenda as a plan for the wealthy elite to impose restrictive policies (rationing) on the general public, characterizing the international climate policy framework as exploitative and abusive towards ordinary citizens."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by depicting international green policies (from the WEF) as tyrannical instruments, but it does not specifically describe them as exploitative international relations or as neo-colonialism. It is a distinct argument about elite-driven tyranny, which is a remainder not captured by the specific subnarratives."

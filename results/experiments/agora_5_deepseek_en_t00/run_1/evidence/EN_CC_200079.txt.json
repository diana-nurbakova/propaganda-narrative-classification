    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames a climate-related policy recommendation (reducing laundry frequency) as an extreme infringement on a basic right, directly criticizing the policy's impact and motive."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the World Economic Forum, accusing it of hypocrisy and of targeting ordinary citizens while protecting elites."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "The text connects the WEF's climate guidelines with its praise for China's policies and its gathering of global elites, implying environmental initiatives are tools for geopolitical alignment and consolidating influence among powerful groups."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The language ('ordered compliant governments', 'move towards a future') suggests a covert, top-down plan by a powerful globalist entity (the WEF) to impose restrictive controls on the public."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "According to the WEF, the global fashion industry is estimated to generate 92 million tonnes of textile waste each year, and the public must reduce amount by wearing dirty clothes instead of washing them after use.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the proposed policy (wearing dirty clothes to reduce waste) as an absurd and impractical solution, implicitly criticizing it as an ineffective way to address environmental goals."

      "evidence_quote": "The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "This statement suggests climate policies (restricting clothing purchases) will directly limit consumer choice and economic activity in the retail sector, implying a negative economic impact."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote contrasts the proposed restrictive policies for the public with the lavish, high-carbon lifestyles of elites, implying the policies are hypocritical and serve to protect elite interests and systems rather than genuinely address climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by framing climate policies as an unjust infringement on fundamental personal rights and freedoms, which is a distinct criticism not covered by the other specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The text directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and 'ordering' governments, portraying it as an overreaching authority imposing unreasonable lifestyle changes on the public under the guise of climate policy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes specific political figures ('neoliberal politicians') and the elite class associated with the WEF for hypocrisy, accusing them of excessive personal carbon emissions while advocating for restrictive policies for ordinary citizens."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities (the WEF) but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives. It accuses the WEF of protecting elite privileges while designing environmental policies that target and strip rights from ordinary citizens, which is a broader criticism of its motives and governance."

      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames international climate policy (promoted by the WEF) as an exploitative tool used by elites to abuse the rights of ordinary citizens while protecting their own privileges, fitting the definition of criticizing climate-related international relations as economically abusive."

      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote, combined with the context of the 'Summer Davos' being held in China, suggests green/globalist policies are instruments for geopolitical alignment and favoritism, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting the more specific definitions of 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism'."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the climate change agenda as a pretext for imposing severe lifestyle restrictions and stripping away fundamental rights, suggesting the stated environmental motive hides a true motive of social control."

      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups by highlighting their hypocrisy and suggesting their climate advocacy is insincere, but it does not neatly fit the definitions of 'Blaming global elites' (which is more about attribution of the agenda) or 'Climate agenda has hidden motives' (which is about the agenda's purpose). It is a distinct argument about elite hypocrisy reinforcing the narrative of a secretive, self-serving scheme."

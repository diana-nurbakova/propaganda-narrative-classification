      "evidence_quote": "CO2 is the GREENING molecule: New study shows how elevated CO2 levels increase vegetation growth and WATER AVAILABILITY in the Northern Hemisphere",
      "reasoning": "The headline and article frame elevated CO2 levels as a direct, positive cause of increased vegetation growth and water availability, presenting climate change as beneficial."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The very compound that the Democrats are targeting – CO2 – is actually the solution to preserving croplands, grasslands, forests and water supplies for growing populations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes climate policies (specifically targeting CO2 reduction) by arguing they are misguided and that the targeted substance is, in fact, beneficial."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s a spiral of death and destruction, coming from a death cult pretending to be the planet’s savior.",
      "reasoning": "This statement uses extreme, pejorative language ('death cult') to attack the integrity and motives of those advocating for climate action, characterizing the movement as destructive and deceitful."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Climate change is beneficial: CO2 is beneficial",
      "evidence_quote": "Elevated CO2 levels enhance vegetation growth through the so-called \"fertilization effect\" and improve water use efficiency. This indirect effect boosts water availability by reducing overall water consumption per unit of biomass.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that increased CO2 levels have positive impacts on vegetation growth and water efficiency, which aligns with the definition of the 'CO2 is beneficial' subnarrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Climate change is beneficial: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The very compound that the Democrats are targeting – CO2 – is actually the solution to preserving croplands, grasslands, forests and water supplies for growing populations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames CO2 as a beneficial 'solution' for preserving ecosystems and resources for humanity, supporting the parent narrative that climate change is beneficial, but it does not fit neatly into the 'CO2 is beneficial' subnarrative as it makes a broader, more political claim about CO2 being a solution to resource preservation."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The sequestration of carbon dioxide is a grave mistake that will slowly harm important ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a core climate policy (carbon sequestration) by claiming it will cause harm, implying the policy fails to achieve its intended environmental goal and is counterproductive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Democrats will continue to deride 'climate change' as the greatest threat and continue to guilt the world into paying more to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames climate action as a financial scheme, suggesting the motivation is to extract payments ('guilt the world into paying more') rather than address genuine environmental concerns."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The very compound that the Democrats are targeting – CO2 – is actually the solution to preserving croplands, grasslands, forests and water supplies for growing populations.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by criticizing the foundational premise of climate policies (targeting CO2), claiming CO2 is beneficial. It does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive, but instead presents a scientific/ideological counter-argument to policy rationale."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Of course, as wildfires and droughts increase, Democrats will continue to deride “climate change” as the greatest threat and continue to guilt the world into paying more to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It’s a spiral of death and destruction, coming from a death cult pretending to be the planet’s savior.",
      "reasoning": "This quote characterizes the climate movement (specifically 'Democrats') as exaggerating threats ('deride “climate change” as the greatest threat') and engaging in fearmongering ('spiral of death and destruction'), which aligns with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement's core policy goal (targeting CO2 reduction) by framing it as misguided and counterproductive, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions Russia's invasion as a cause, but also includes 'the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych' as a contributing factor to Ukraine's financial crisis. This fits the narrative of shifting some blame for negative outcomes (Ukraine's economic distress) onto a Ukrainian actor, alongside the primary invader."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lauds the 'free world' (a term commonly associated with Western democracies) as the force for good against tyranny, framing its victory as a moral triumph. It excessively extols the virtues and moral superiority of the West in the context of the conflict."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear by speculating about direct, catastrophic attacks on civilian infrastructure in major Western European capitals, suggesting the war could spread to the West if Ukraine is not adequately supported."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the conflict as one where the 'civilized world' (the West) is actively taking financial and economic measures against an 'aggressor'. While it does not name Russia directly as the aggressor here, the context of the article is Russia's war on Ukraine. The statement implies the West's actions (sanctions, asset confiscation) are part of the war effort, subtly shifting the narrative to include Western financial warfare as a key component of the conflict, aligning with the subnarrative of blaming the war on the West as aggressors through their economic actions."

      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This statement attributes part of the cause for Ukraine's 2015 economic crisis not only to Russia's invasion but also to the 'poor policies' of a former Ukrainian president. This fits the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by introducing a domestic Ukrainian political figure as a contributing factor to the nation's vulnerability and subsequent financial distress, which is a form of shifting responsibility beyond the primary invader. It does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' subnarratives, hence it is classified as 'Other'."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames the conflict as a moral battle where the 'free world' (a term synonymous with the West and its allies) is on the side of justice against 'dictators and tyrants', portraying Western support as morally superior and aligned with a just world order."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support",
      "evidence_quote": "The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine...",
      "reasoning": "This statement emphasizes the 'unity of the free world' and its 'unwavering long-term' support, presenting Western backing as a cohesive, powerful, and decisive factor for victory, which aligns with the subnarrative of strong international support for Western-aligned actions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This passage overpraises the West by portraying it as the 'civilized world' that needs protection, implicitly contrasting it with a barbaric aggressor. It frames Western support for Ukraine as a defensive shield for Western cities themselves, elevating the West's role and moral imperative to act."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly warns that if Ukraine does not prevail, the threat of Russian military aggression will extend to other European countries, specifically naming cities in NATO members (Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Czech Republic). This directly matches the definition of evoking fear that Russia will attack other countries."

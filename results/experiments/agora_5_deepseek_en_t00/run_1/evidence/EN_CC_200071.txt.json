      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of essential goods and housing to 'green' policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly challenges the competence and impact of the Biden administration's policies, framing them as harmful to the average American, which fits the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses strong skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar, labeling them as inefficient, expensive, environmentally destructive, and incapable of meeting energy demands, which aligns with the controversy about green technologies narrative."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote, following criticism of green policies, frames them as weakening America's strategic and military position, suggesting they are tools that undermine national strength in geopolitical competition rather than being purely for environmental benefit."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of housing, fuel, and utilities to climate policies, arguing they negatively impact the economy by making essential goods and services unaffordable."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "\"These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the promoted renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are environmentally destructive and incapable of meeting energy demands, suggesting the policies promoting them are ineffective at achieving their stated goals."

      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies on grounds of national security and military preparedness, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific subnarratives of economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "This direct statement criticizes the policies of the U.S. national government (the Biden administration) for their negative impact on housing affordability, directly disapproving of how the government handles climate-related policy."

      "evidence_quote": "who warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's \"globalist green agenda.\"",
      "reasoning": "The term \"globalist green agenda\" is used to discredit the climate policy approach of a specific political figure (President Biden), framing it as a harmful and ideologically driven agenda."

      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes... Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes.",
      "reasoning": "This criticizes a specific government agency (the Department of Energy) and its program, which is an institution/authority. While it relates to national government policy, the specific criticism of a federal agency's directive and its coercive effect on local governments and developers represents a distinct criticism of institutional action that supports the parent narrative but is not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are both inefficient and expensive, which matches the definition of the subnarrative focusing on the high cost and inefficiency of renewables."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is unreliable",
      "evidence_quote": "These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "The claim that renewable sources \"cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy\" needed for prosperity directly supports the subnarrative that renewable energy is unreliable and not dependable for widespread adoption."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "\"BLINDED by MONEY: Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly claims that wind farms are killing wildlife (eagles and whales), portraying renewable energy infrastructure as posing significant risks and dangers to the environment."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The remainder of the fund will go toward implementing \"zero energy\" building codes, which will require residential buildings to install small-scale renewable energy generators \"to achieve zero-net carbon.\" This additional spending for owners of houses and residential buildings comes at a period in the United States when families are already struggling to afford a home.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by criticizing green policies (specifically building codes mandating renewable energy installations) for making housing unaffordable. This specific angle—linking green tech mandates directly to housing affordability crises—is not captured by the more specific subnarratives about cost, reliability, or danger of the energy sources themselves."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Edward Ring, an author and a senior fellow with the conservative think tank, the California Policy Center, who warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'\"",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' is a distinct argument supporting the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments. It suggests the policies are driven by internationalist or supranational interests, which is a specific theme not captured by the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives."

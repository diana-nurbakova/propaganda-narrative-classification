      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian state media and government officials have taken to describing any opponents of the Kremlin in Ukraine as or “Banderites,” the followers of Stepan Bandera... This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The text describes the Russian state media's strategy of broadly labeling Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites' or 'Nazis,' which is a method to undermine the legitimacy and character of Ukrainian resistance and national identity."

      "evidence_quote": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to negotiate with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is being packaged as a sign of his love and good will... “This, of course, is a demonstration of his greatest respect and—I would even say—of love by our President towards the Ukrainian people.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Putin's actions as stemming from 'love' and 'good will,' which is a positive, even heroic, characterization of Russia's leader and his intentions, aligning with the narrative of praising Russia."

      "evidence_quote": "“There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes and undermines the United States by portraying it as gullible and easily controlled, which fits the narrative of discrediting Western nations."

      "evidence_quote": "“Here’s what will be on the table after our victory... The dissolution of NATO... Extradition of all war criminals... like Zelensky... We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself... The return of all Russian properties... Are you including Alaska and Fort Ross?”",
      "reasoning": "This extensive list details severe and humiliating demands and consequences for the West (dissolution of NATO, reparations, territorial concessions) that are presented as inevitable outcomes of Russia's victory, highlighting negative consequences for Western interests and prestige."

For example, the lifting of all sanctions... The dissolution of NATO... Extradition of all war criminals... I think we should start voicing all of that, so they understand what will be on the table.”",
      "reasoning": "The speaker is making detailed predictions and assumptions about the potential results and concessions following a Russian victory, which is the core of speculating about war outcomes."

Tactical or strategic, take a pick. You took our money, you’re the thieves, our talk is short with you: a bullet to the head.”",
      "reasoning": "This is a direct and explicit threat of nuclear retaliation and violence against those who sanctioned Russia, designed to evoke fear and anxiety about severe consequences."

      "reasoning": "This distorted claim amplifies war-related fears by suggesting the U.S. and NATO will not intervene even in the face of extreme Russian escalation (biological/nuclear weapons), creating a sense of unchecked aggression and peril. It supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of WW3, attacking other countries, nuclear use, or NATO intervention."

      "evidence_quote": "She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.” Russian state media and government officials have taken to describing any opponents of the Kremlin in Ukraine as or “Banderites,” the followers of Stepan Bandera, the ultranationalist political figure who fought for Ukrainian independence before being assassinated by the KGB in 1959. This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly labels Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites,' a term used to associate them with historical ultranationalist figures and, by extension, Nazi ideology, which aligns with the subnarrative of associating Ukraine with nazism."

      "evidence_quote": "The segment was entitled “Denazification of Ukraine—the new opportunities for growth” and appeared to serve as a tool to desensitize the Russian population for the grotesque war trials and executions the Kremlin is reportedly planning to conduct in Ukraine...",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by framing its resistance as requiring 'denazification' and planning public executions, which is a manipulative argument not captured by the other specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "“Right now, President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin’s third proposal to the Ukrainian leadership is on the table. This, of course, is a demonstration of his greatest respect and—I would even say—of love by our President towards the Ukrainian people.”",
      "reasoning": "The statement packages Putin's negotiation attempts as a benevolent gesture of goodwill, portraying Russia (through its leader) as a force offering a peaceful resolution, which fits the narrative of Russia being a provider of peace."

The dissolution of NATO... Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko [former deputy minister at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs], Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko. Extradition of various oligarchs, like [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky.”",
      "reasoning": "While not directly praising support, the pundit's list of future demands (dissolution of NATO, extraditions) presupposes a position of such overwhelming strength and international acquiescence that it implies Russia's actions will be accepted or enforced globally, aligning with the theme of Russia's dominant international position."

As well as the Antarctic... We discovered it, so it belongs to us...”",
      "reasoning": "These statements portray Russia in a supremely powerful and entitled light, claiming historical and future rights to territory and reparations. This supports the parent narrative of praising Russia by presenting it as a rightful, dominant global power destined to reclaim its legacy, but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "Multiple state TV shows emphasized the reluctance on the part of the United States and NATO to intervene against Russia’s bloody invasion of its neighbor, presenting it as the proof that the Kremlin can go to any lengths to emerge victorious.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the West's (U.S. and NATO) reluctance to intervene militarily as proof of weakness, allowing Russia to act with impunity, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as non-potent."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the American public is indifferent to Ukraine's fate, suggesting Western support is not driven by genuine concern for Ukraine but by other, likely self-serving, interests."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "Olga Skabeeva, the host of a state TV show 60 Minutes, intentionally distorted the statements of White House press secretary Jen Psaki. On Friday, Skabeeva claimed: “Jennifer Psaki’s statement said that no matter what Putin does in Ukraine—whether he uses biological weapons or drops a nuclear bomb—the United States won’t get involved.”",
      "reasoning": "By fabricating a claim that the U.S. said it wouldn't intervene even against nuclear use, the propagandist implies that Western warnings and reactions (like sanctions) are hollow and disproportionate bluffs, not serious responses to Russian actions."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by outlining a catastrophic negative consequence for the West (the dissolution of its primary military alliance) as a direct result of the conflict, which does not fit the more specific 'sanctions backfire' or 'refugee flows' subnarratives."

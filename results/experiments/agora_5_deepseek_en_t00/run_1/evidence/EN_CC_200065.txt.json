      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly challenges the scientific basis of the claims about historical temperatures by pointing out the limited timeframe of direct data collection, casting doubt on the methods used to establish long-term records."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather... Not content with these extravagant claims... But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "The text uses the pejorative term 'alarmists' and describes claims as 'extravagant,' suggesting the climate movement is exaggerating and prioritizing narrative over scientific rigor, which aligns with the definition of challenging the movement's motives and impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather... But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "By framing the reporting of record heat as mere 'lamenting' over 'warm weather' and implying the story is more important than science, the text minimizes the significance and urgency of the climate change phenomenon being reported."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Methodologies/metrics used are unreliable/faulty",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the reliability of the paleoclimate proxy data (tree rings, ice cores) used to make claims about temperatures thousands of years ago, framing them as fundamentally different and incompatible with direct instrumental measurements."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Data shows no temperature increase",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This statement casts doubt on claims of record-breaking heat by arguing that the instrumental data record is too short to support such long-term historical comparisons, implicitly suggesting the data does not reliably show an unprecedented increase."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Scientific community is unreliable",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question sarcastically implies that climate scientists and reporters are prioritizing a sensational narrative ('a good story') over genuine scientific rigor, thereby discrediting the reliability and motives of the scientific community."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely “the hottest day in thousands of years.”",
      "reasoning": "The text opens by labeling those making climate claims as 'alarmists' and frames their statements about record heat as 'extravagant claims,' directly suggesting the movement exaggerates severity for dramatic effect."

      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This concluding rhetorical question dismissively implies the climate movement's narrative is unscientific and driven by a desire for a compelling 'story' rather than facts, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.'"

      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The quote casts doubt on claims about long-term climate trends by emphasizing the short duration of modern instrumental records, implying that the observed warming could be part of a longer, natural cycle not captured by recent data."

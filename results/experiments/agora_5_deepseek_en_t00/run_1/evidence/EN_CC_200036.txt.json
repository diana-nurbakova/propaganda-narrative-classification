      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate cultists push bizarre scare language about weather: “rain bombs” and “boiling oceans”",
      "reasoning": "The opening phrase 'Climate cultists' is a derogatory term that challenges the integrity and rationality of the climate movement, framing its language as 'bizarre' and alarmist."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "\"That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers, and the rain bombs, and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level, and causing these waves of climate refugees, predicted to reach one billion in this century.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quoted statement from Al Gore, presented in the text, lists catastrophic consequences and a prediction of 'one billion' refugees, which serves as a clear example of amplifying fears about climate change."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for \"renewable energy,\" meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the Inflation Reduction Act's funding for renewable energy, questioning its effectiveness by suggesting it will lead to a 'dark and cold future,' thereby challenging the economic and practical impact of the climate policy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "\"I have been hearing about these end of the world scenarios since I was a kid. And not one of their predictions has come true. Global cooling, global warming, mass extinction, mass famine, the polar ice caps melting, mass flooding, the ozone layer depleted, etc.\"",
      "reasoning": "This commenter's statement minimizes the significance of climate change by asserting that past predictions have consistently failed, thereby downplaying the current threat and scientific consensus."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate cultists push bizarre scare language about weather: “rain bombs” and “boiling oceans”",
      "reasoning": "The opening phrase labels climate activists as 'cultists' and characterizes their terminology as 'bizarre scare language,' directly accusing them of using exaggerated, frightening terms to describe weather events, which aligns with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Gore would know about fossil fuel use, seeing as how he uses lots and lots of it – much more than the average person, in fact – to power his lavish, sprawling estates and fuel his private jets.",
      "reasoning": "This statement attacks Al Gore's personal credibility and reputation by highlighting his alleged hypocrisy in using fossil fuels extensively, which is a direct ad hominem attack on a key figure in the climate movement."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Renewable energy ... is now the cheapest source of electricity in almost the entire planet,\" Gore lied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses Al Gore of lying about the cost of renewable energy. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement by alleging dishonesty, but this specific claim of lying does not fit neatly into the 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem' subnarratives as defined. It is a distinct criticism of the movement's messaging."

      "evidence_quote": "\"the accumulated amount is now trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every single day on the Earth\" ... \"That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers, and the rain bombs, and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level, and causing these waves of climate refugees, predicted to reach one billion in this century.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote presents an intense, catastrophic scenario involving extreme heat, environmental destruction, and a massive displacement of one billion people, directly matching the definition of presenting doomsday scenarios for humans as a result of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "\"boiling the oceans\" and causing \"rain bombs\" ... \"creating these atmospheric rivers\" ... \"sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level\"",
      "reasoning": "The text uses exaggerated and alarming language (e.g., 'boiling oceans,' 'rain bombs') to describe weather and climate phenomena, speculating on severe side effects to amplify existing public fears related to global warming."

And not one of their predictions has come true. Global cooling, global warming, mass extinction, mass famine, the polar ice caps melting, mass flooding, the ozone layer depleted, etc.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by framing climate warnings as a long history of failed, alarmist predictions, which is a tactic to amplify fears by suggesting the movement is inherently hysterical and untrustworthy. This specific argument does not fit the definitions of the other provided subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that the predictions made by climate advocates, which form the basis for policy, have consistently failed, implying the policies built on them are ineffective."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "\"The legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for 'renewable energy,' meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames climate policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) as leading to a negative outcome ('a very dark and cold future'), which is a clear criticism of its economic and societal impact, suggesting it will reduce energy affordability and abundance."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Gore would know about fossil fuel use, seeing as how he uses lots and lots of it – much more than the average person, in fact – to power his lavish, sprawling estates and fuel his private jets.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote attacks the personal hypocrisy of a key climate policy advocate, implying his advocacy is not genuine and is compatible with a lavish, high-consumption lifestyle, suggesting the movement may be driven by personal gain or hypocrisy rather than true environmental concern."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the communication and rhetoric used to promote climate policies, framing it as alarmist and manipulative ('scare language'). This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the definitions of the specific subnarratives related to effectiveness, economic impact, or profit motive."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change by dismissing climate concerns as failed alarmist predictions, but it does not align with any of the specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it does not argue about natural cycles, weather trends, or specific impacts). It is a general dismissal of climate science predictions."

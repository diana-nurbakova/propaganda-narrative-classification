      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto Western nations (the UK and US), framing them as the actors who prevented a peaceful settlement."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine. As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "This passage undermines Ukraine's military and governmental effectiveness by highlighting desperate and potentially unpopular conscription measures, portraying the state as struggling and coercive."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Western (and Ukrainian) policy as reckless and counterproductive, directly discrediting their diplomatic and military strategy as pointless and dangerous."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This language evokes fear by suggesting that current Western-supported actions are moving the world toward a catastrophic nuclear event, amplifying anxieties about the conflict's potential global consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the prolongation of the war on Ukraine and its Western backers for their escalatory actions, rather than on Russia's initial invasion and continued aggression. It is a distinct argument not captured by the specific 'West are the aggressors' subnarrative, which focused on the origin of the war, while this focuses on its prolongation."

      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by highlighting the failure of a major military operation and net territorial loss."

      "reasoning": "This statement delegitimizes the Ukrainian government's decision-making, portraying it as incompetent and easily manipulated by foreign powers, leading to a catastrophic war for its people."

      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This claim explicitly frames Ukraine's decision to continue fighting as being directed by the US and UK, supporting the narrative that Ukraine is not an independent actor but a puppet of Western powers."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv... But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This paints a picture of inevitable defeat, emphasizing Ukraine's lack of manpower and inability to achieve its military objectives, thereby portraying the situation as having no viable positive future."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by portraying its government and its Western allies as reckless and irresponsible, escalating a conflict pointlessly. This specific argument—that Ukraine's actions are provocative and strategically futile—does not neatly fit the definitions of the other, more specific subnarratives provided."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly contrasts Russia's strong and increasing military production with the West's comparatively weaker output, presenting the West as non-potent and unable to match Russia's war effort."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims Western powers (UK and US) sabotaged a potential peace deal that would have benefited Ukraine, prioritizing a continued conflict (presumably for their own geopolitical interests) over Ukraine's well-being and territorial integrity."

      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "This concluding statement frames current Western strategy as a fantasy of military victory, implicitly discrediting it, and suggests diplomacy ('words') as the only viable alternative, implying that the current diplomatic/political approach is not being pursued and is being ignored to Ukraine's detriment."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But the West’s chosen depiction of Putin as a tyrant bent on conquering the entire European continent suffered its latest setback last month when it came out that the Russian president is interested in halting the fighting and negotiating a deal that recognizes the current battlefield lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by discrediting the West's characterization of the conflict and its motives (painting Putin as an existential threat), arguing instead that Russia is open to diplomacy, which undermines the Western rationale for continued support and escalation. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives provided."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII",
      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly warns against continuing a large-scale offensive against Russia, framing it as a dangerous fantasy that could lead to a catastrophic escalation, implicitly evoking the fear of a world war if diplomacy is not pursued."

      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear by claiming that recent escalatory actions are moving the world toward a 'catastrophic nuclear accident,' directly supporting the subnarrative about the risk of nuclear weapons being employed."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia. Around the same time, Ukraine struck two Russian strategic nuclear early-warning radars... The escalations have not been one-sided. Russia conducted drills simulating the use of strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus and has sent warships and a submarine to the Caribbean.",
      "reasoning": "This detailed description of reciprocal escalatory actions (NATO-allowed strikes into Russia, attacks on nuclear early-warning systems, Russian nuclear drills, and naval deployments) amplifies war-related fears by depicting a dangerous tit-for-tat spiral. While it touches on nuclear themes, its primary focus is on the broader, escalating conflict dynamics that heighten fear and tension, which is not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives."

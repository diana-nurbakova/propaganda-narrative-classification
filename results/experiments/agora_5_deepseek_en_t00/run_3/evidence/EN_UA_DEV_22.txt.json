      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by blaming the war's continuation on external supporters (the EU) for supplying weapons, but its primary framing is a pan-Slavic appeal rather than a direct accusation of Ukraine or the West being the initial aggressor. It is a distinct argument not covered by the specific subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by amplifying fears related to the war (portraying it as a destructive, foreign proxy conflict that harms European interests), but it does not fit the definitions of the more specific subnarratives about WW3, Russia attacking other countries, nuclear weapons, or NATO intervention."

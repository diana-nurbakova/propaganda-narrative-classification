      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly questions the effectiveness and catastrophic consequences of the climate policy advocated by the Just Stop Oil movement, framing it as genocidal."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The theory that climate fanatics have adopted as to why this is all happening blames human activity and industry... member of groups like Just Stop Oil have been deluded – or perhaps deluded themselves – into believing that they must appease the climate gods",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the motives and intellectual integrity of the climate movement, labeling them as 'fanatics' and 'deluded,' and framing their beliefs as a quasi-religious appeasement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This statement minimizes the significance of human-caused climate change by arguing that natural sources are a larger contributor, thereby downplaying the impact of anthropogenic emissions."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "The text cites an authority figure to cast doubt on the scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, directly questioning the science behind climate policy."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the proposed climate policy (stopping oil use) as leading to a catastrophic outcome (mass death), arguing it would fail to protect human life and society, thus suggesting the policy is ineffective and counterproductive to its presumed goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "On the very first day of an oil- and gas-free world... all homes, businesses, and other structures that rely on either or both of these for light, heat, fuel, or what have you would no longer function.",
      "reasoning": "This statement predicts a complete collapse of the energy-dependent infrastructure that underpins modern economic and social life, framing the policy as having a devastating negative impact on the economy and basic societal functioning."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The theory that climate fanatics have adopted... blames human activity and industry, even though the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by challenging the scientific basis for climate policies, arguing that natural sources are the primary cause of emissions, not human activity. This critique of the policy's foundational premise does not fit the definitions of 'ineffective', 'negative economic impact', or 'only for profit'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'fear of \"boiling oceans\"' uses exaggerated, alarmist language to characterize the climate movement's warnings, suggesting they are hyperbolic and not based in reality."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly alleges that the climate movement's position is driven by manipulative communication ('propaganda'), implying it is not based on genuine science or ethics but on deceptive influence."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "If we 'just stop oil' like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die... Six billion deaths are about as genocidal as it gets...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes the climate movement by claiming its proposed actions would lead to catastrophic, genocidal human death, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem' subnarratives. It is a distinct form of criticism based on predicted consequences."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Human activities do not impact climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that natural sources (volcanoes) emit more greenhouse gases than human activities (cars, cattle), thereby arguing that human activity is not the primary driver of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by citing an authority figure to claim that the scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels is lacking. It downplays the urgency and validity of climate action but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about natural cycles, weather, CO2 concentration, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Greenhouse effect/carbon dioxide do not drive climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the scientific consensus by asserting that natural sources of greenhouse gases dwarf human contributions, thereby arguing that human-caused CO2 is not the primary driver of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Scientific community is unreliable",
      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses the authority of a COP28 president to claim a lack of scientific basis for a major climate policy, thereby discrediting the scientific consensus that supports fossil fuel phase-out."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Do you believe the planet is melting or boiling due to man-made climate change? Learn more about why this is not the case at Climate.news.",
      "reasoning": "This statement dismisses the core claims of man-made climate change ('melting or boiling') as false and directs readers to a source that contradicts mainstream climate science. It supports the parent narrative of questioning climate science but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about data, methodology, or the scientific community's reliability."

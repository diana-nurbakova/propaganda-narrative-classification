This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly labels Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites,' a term used to associate them with Stepan Bandera and, by extension, Nazi collaborationist ideology, thereby discrediting Ukraine by linking it to Nazism."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames the conflict as between Russia and the Ukrainian 'leadership,' implicitly suggesting the leadership is a separate entity from the people and is the obstacle to peace, aligning with the narrative that Ukraine is not acting independently but as a proxy for Western interests resisting Russian overtures."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the overarching narrative of discrediting Ukraine by portraying it as a source of financial liability and damage to Russia, demanding reparations. It undermines Ukraine's position but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about history, the nation, the military, government, puppetry, crime, Nazism, or hopelessness)."

      "reasoning": "The statement packages Putin's negotiation attempts as a benevolent gesture of goodwill, portraying Russia (through its leader) as a party seeking a peaceful resolution, which fits the narrative of Russia being a positive, peace-providing force."

The dissolution of NATO... Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko [former deputy minister at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs], Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko. Extradition of various oligarchs, like [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky.”",
      "reasoning": "While not stating explicit support, the quote implies Russia's power and future victory will force international concessions (dissolution of NATO, extraditions), suggesting a worldview where Russia's position is so strong it will command compliance, indirectly supporting the idea of its international standing and acceptance of its demands."

The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.” ... “That was my next point. As well as the Antarctic... We discovered it, so it belongs to us...”",
      "reasoning": "These statements portray Russia as a powerful, victorious, and historically justified claimant to vast territories and reparations. This supports the parent narrative of praising Russia by presenting it as a dominant, rightful, and triumphant global power, but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about military might, Putin, peace, or explicit international support)."

      "evidence_quote": "Multiple state TV shows emphasized the reluctance on the part of the United States and NATO to intervene against Russia’s bloody invasion of its neighbor, presenting it as the proof that the Kremlin can go to any lengths to emerge victorious.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the West's (U.S. and NATO) reluctance to intervene militarily as proof of weakness, allowing Russia to act with impunity, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as non-potent."

      "evidence_quote": "She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the American public is indifferent to Ukraine's fate, suggesting Western support is not driven by genuine concern for Ukraine but by other, likely self-serving, interests."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "Olga Skabeeva, the host of a state TV show 60 Minutes, intentionally distorted the statements of White House press secretary Jen Psaki. On Friday, Skabeeva claimed: “Jennifer Psaki’s statement said that no matter what Putin does in Ukraine—whether he uses biological weapons or drops a nuclear bomb—the United States won’t get involved.”",
      "reasoning": "By fabricating a claim that the U.S. stated it would not intervene even in the face of extreme Russian actions (nuclear/bio weapons), the narrative implies that Western concerns and reactions to Russia's actual invasion are disproportionate and alarmist."

      "evidence_quote": "Matveychev noted: “There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West by portraying the United States as gullible and easily controlled, which is a manipulative communication pattern not captured by the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames Western sanctions as causing damage to Russia, for which Russia will demand financial reparations from the West, implying the sanctions will ultimately cost the West money."

      "evidence_quote": "\"The dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by outlining a catastrophic negative consequence for the West (the dissolution of its primary military alliance) as a demanded outcome of Russia's victory, which does not fit the more specific subnarratives about sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to negotiate with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is being packaged as a sign of his love and good will, and not the consequence of mounting losses and humiliating defeats faced by the Russian military in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that the Russian military is facing 'mounting losses and humiliating defeats,' which is a clear claim of a significant decline in its effectiveness and strength, matching the definition of the subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "According to top Kremlin propagandists, it’s only a matter of time before the West admits its defeat and pays reparations to Moscow or risks a devastating nuclear strike.",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on the outcome of the conflict, predicting Western defeat and reparations to Moscow. It supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes but does not fit the specific definitions about the Russian or Ukrainian army collapsing or losing territories; it is a broader speculative claim about the war's conclusion."

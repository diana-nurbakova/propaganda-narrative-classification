      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policy (in this case, guidelines on washing frequency) as an unjust infringement on fundamental personal rights, questioning its motives and impact on daily life."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the WEF, accusing it of hypocrisy and of targeting ordinary citizens while protecting elite privileges."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "The text connects the WEF's environmental advocacy (the washing guidelines) with its praise for China's policies and its gathering of global elites, suggesting environmental policies are tools for geopolitical alignment and consolidating elite power rather than genuine environmental concern."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The language ('ordered compliant governments', 'move towards a future') portrays the WEF as a shadowy, powerful entity orchestrating a global plan to restrict personal freedoms, fitting the narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote contrasts the massive carbon footprint of the elite with the trivial impact of public laundry, arguing that the policy focus is misdirected and therefore ineffective at addressing the real sources of emissions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly claims that climate policies are designed to protect elite financial interests ('perks and privileges for billionaires') while imposing burdens on ordinary citizens, framing the policies as a tool for profit and power preservation rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by portraying them as an extreme, rights-stripping overreach that infringes on personal hygiene and dignity, a theme not captured by the more specific economic or profit-driven subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The text directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and ordering governments to limit citizens' consumption, portraying it as an overreaching authority."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes specific political figures and elites ('globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians') for hypocrisy in their climate actions, directly discrediting them in the context of the climate debate."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities (the WEF) by accusing it of protecting elite privileges while targeting citizens' rights, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of criticizing the EU, national governments, or international entities in a standard policy sense. It adds a distinct layer of criticism about the institution's motives and class bias."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames international climate policy (promoted by the WEF) as an exploitative tool used by elites to abuse the rights of ordinary citizens, aligning with the definition of criticizing climate-related international relations as economically abusive and exploitative."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing “the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote, combined with the context of the 'Summer Davos' being held in China, suggests green policies and global forums are instruments for geopolitical alignment and influence, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting the specific definitions of 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism'."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly claims that the WEF's climate agenda (focusing on public restrictions) is driven by the ulterior motive of protecting elite privileges and stripping rights from ordinary citizens, rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups by highlighting their hypocrisy and suggesting their climate advocacy is not sincere, but it does not fit neatly into the 'Blaming global elites' or 'Climate agenda has hidden motives' definitions as it focuses on behavioral contradiction rather than direct blame for the agenda or its stated ulterior motives."

      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of essential goods and housing to 'green' policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses strong skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies, labeling them as inefficient, expensive, environmentally destructive, and incapable of meeting energy demands."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames green policies not as environmental measures, but as actions that weaken national strength and security, implying they serve a geopolitical purpose contrary to American interests."

      "evidence_quote": "\"These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that the promoted renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are environmentally destructive and incapable of meeting energy needs, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended environmental and practical goals."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames climate policies as undermining national security and military strength, which is a criticism of the policies but does not fit the definitions of the other specific subnarratives (economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive)."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the policies of a specific political figure (President Biden), blaming his 'green policies' for negative economic consequences, which fits the definition of discrediting political figures in the climate change debate."

      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes... Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the actions of the U.S. national government (Biden's Department of Energy) for implementing policies that are framed as burdensome and costly, directly disapproving of how the national government is handling climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "We are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware. Explore our decentralized, peer-to-peer, uncensorable Brighteon.io free speech platform here.",
      "reasoning": "This statement promotes an alternative platform in opposition to mainstream institutions, implying criticism of established authorities (like media or government) for being censorable or not empowering. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit the specific definitions of criticizing the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures."

      "evidence_quote": "\"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are incapable of meeting the energy demands required for prosperity, which aligns with the definition of unreliability for widespread adoption."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly labels wind, solar, and biomass as 'inefficient and expensive,' directly supporting the subnarrative that renewable energy is too costly and inefficient for widespread use."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "\"These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance\"",
      "reasoning": "This claim characterizes renewable energy infrastructure as environmentally destructive and resource-intensive, framing it as posing significant risks or dangers to the environment, which fits the subnarrative definition."

      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\"",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies by linking them to broad socio-economic affordability crises (housing, energy bills), but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about the energy sources themselves being dangerous, unreliable, costly, or nuclear not being climate friendly."

      "evidence_quote": "Edward Ring... warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' frames climate policies not as domestic environmental measures but as instruments of a supranational or foreign-aligned agenda, supporting the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments, though it does not fit the specific definitions of 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism'."

      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet... Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly highlights adverse economic outcomes (high electricity prices, inflation) for Germany and other European nations as a consequence of the disruption of Russian gas, which is framed as a result of the sanctions regime and geopolitical crisis related to the Russia-Ukraine war."

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock...",
      "reasoning": "This statement lists the war, Western sanctions, and pipeline sabotage as causes of Germany's energy crisis. It implicitly shifts blame for the negative economic consequences away from Russia's invasion by presenting the Western sanctions response as a primary causative factor alongside the war itself."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question directly criticizes and discredits the competence and judgment of German (and by extension, Western) leadership, blaming them for the suffering of the population due to their energy and climate policies."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links the Western sanctions regime to a severe negative consequence for Germany (energy crisis, high prices), framing the sanctions as a self-inflicted wound that forced a desperate scramble for alternatives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This describes a broad negative economic consequence (high energy prices and inflation) for Western nations (Germany, Italy, Denmark) as a direct result of the disruption of Russian gas supplies, which is tied to the conflict and sanctions. It supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West but is a broader economic argument not exclusively about sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly identifies the Western sanctions regime as a direct cause of Germany's energy crisis, shifting the responsibility for the economic hardship away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and onto the actions of the United States and the West."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What President Donald Trump was referring to in 2018 was Germany’s increasing dependence on Russian gas, which in turn resulted from “green” energy policies implemented over the previous decade. These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity...",
      "reasoning": "This argument blames Germany's vulnerability and subsequent economic crisis on its own 'green fanaticism' and energy policies, which is a form of blaming the war's consequences on others (in this case, domestic political decisions) rather than on the invader, Russia. It supports the parent narrative by attributing the cause of suffering to a party other than Russia."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a division within Europe, specifically between nations that were heavily reliant on Russian gas and those that were not, suggesting the EU is not a unified bloc but a set of entities with differing interests and vulnerabilities."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This statement presents a core Western and EU power, Germany, as economically crippled and weakened due to its own policies and the consequences of the sanctions regime, supporting the narrative of Western decline and lack of potency."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock...",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the Western sanctions regime as a direct cause of Germany's energy and economic crisis, implying the West's reaction (sanctions) has been disproportionate and self-harming, devastating a major Western economy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error.",
      "reasoning": "This implies that the sacrifices Germany is making (linked to sanctions and green policies pursued in alignment with broader Western goals) are futile and not for a meaningful cause like Ukraine's sovereignty, but for negligible global impact ('a rounding error'), suggesting the West's actions are driven by misguided self-interest or ideology rather than genuine concern for Ukraine."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s beleaguered citizens appear to have had enough of this disaster. Political change is in the winds. The populist conservative party, Alternative for Germany, has just emerged as Germany’s second strongest party... One of the party’s main selling points is that it’s 'an aggressive opponent of the government’s energy and climate policy.'",
      "reasoning": "The text connects Germany's economic suffering (framed as a result of the sanctions regime and energy crisis stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war) to rising populist opposition. This suggests domestic fatigue and a political shift against the policies associated with supporting Ukraine, implying the West (starting with Germany) is becoming tired of the consequences of its stance."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage... three climate change radicals stormed the stage.",
      "reasoning": "The terms 'radical climate activist' and 'climate change radicals' are used to describe the protesters, framing the climate movement as extreme and disruptive, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing the movement's motives, integrity, or impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The activist group Restore Wetlands claimed responsibility for the act, saying: 'Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.'",
      "reasoning": "The quoted statement from the activist group explicitly warns of 'climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences,' which directly serves to emphasize and amplify fears about the consequences of climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Watch: Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane After Storming Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The headline uses the derogatory term 'Eco-Loon' to attack the character and sanity of the activist, which is a direct ad hominem attack on a key figure in the climate movement."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the activists' protest as a criminal act of vandalism, which criticizes the movement's methods and supports the parent narrative, but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or a direct ad hominem attack on a named key figure."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This direct quote from the activist group presents an intense catastrophic scenario for humanity as a result of climate change, framing it as a global threat leading to societal collapse."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The activists' statement uses the disruption of a popular event to amplify fears about climate change, justifying extreme actions by invoking a catastrophic threat. This supports the parent narrative of amplifying climate fears but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about uninhabitability, warming fears, or futility."

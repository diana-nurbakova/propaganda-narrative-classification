      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, framing it as a 'balancing act' and highlighting the continued essential role of oil and gas, which implicitly criticizes aggressive climate transition policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "The text describes financial and political pressure (threats to pull pension funds) being used to enforce climate-related investment policies, framing green policies as tools of financial and political power wielded by specific actors (activist investors, a city comptroller) rather than purely environmental measures."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF. The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the banks' climate-related actions primarily as financial investment decisions ('investing $0.81... for every $1'), suggesting the shift is driven by profit-seeking in a growing 'green energy' market rather than purely by environmental concern, aligning with the subnarrative that climate policies are profit-driven."

      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline's phrasing 'Bend The Knee To Climate Activists' frames the banks' policy changes as a submission to activist pressure rather than a rational or independent policy choice, which is a criticism of climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the global push for green energy as potentially exploitative, highlighting how developing nations lack the resources and infrastructure to comply with the rapid shift demanded by international climate alliances and policies, which could place an unfair economic burden on them."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The statement implies that the transition to renewables, driven by international alliances like the Net Zero Banking Alliance, is a policy imposed by developed nations and financial institutions that developing countries are ill-equipped to adopt, suggesting a form of economic and developmental control reminiscent of colonial practices."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios, Bloomberg reported in January. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This describes green policies (like the Net Zero Banking Alliance's requirements) being used as instruments of financial and political pressure, where activist investors and public officials leverage economic power (pension funds) to enforce compliance, extending the narrative of green policies as geopolitical tools beyond international relations into domestic financial coercion."

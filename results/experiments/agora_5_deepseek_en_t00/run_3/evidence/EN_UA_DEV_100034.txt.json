      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly attributes part of the cause for Ukraine's 2015 financial crisis to the 'poor policies' of a former Ukrainian president, alongside mentioning Russia's invasion. This fits the narrative of shifting blame away from the primary aggressor (Russia) by introducing a secondary, internal Ukrainian cause for negative outcomes."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lauds the 'free world' (a term commonly associated with Western democracies) as the collective force for good against tyranny, framing its victory as synonymous with Ukraine's. It excessively extols the moral virtue and role of the West in the conflict."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the conflict as one where the 'civilized world' (the West) is actively engaged in weakening Russia ('the aggressor'), implying the West's actions (sanctions, asset confiscation, assistance to Ukraine) are a form of aggression against Russia, thereby shifting blame for the war's continuation and escalation onto Western policies."

      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This statement attributes Ukraine's 2015 financial crisis not solely to the Russian invasion but also to the 'poor policies' of a former Ukrainian president. This fits the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by introducing a secondary, internal Ukrainian cause for a crisis linked to the conflict, which is not captured by the specific subnarratives about Ukraine or the West being the aggressors."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames the conflict as a moral battle where the 'free world' (a term synonymous with the West and its allies) is on the side of justice against 'dictators and tyrants', portraying Western support as morally superior and aligned with a just world order."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support",
      "evidence_quote": "The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine...",
      "reasoning": "This statement emphasizes the 'unity of the free world' and its 'unwavering long-term' support, presenting Western backing as a cohesive, powerful, and reliable force, which aligns with the subnarrative of strong international support for Western-aligned actions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This argument portrays Western nations (Amsterdam, Warsaw, Berlin, Prague) as part of a 'civilized world' that Ukraine is protecting, overpraising the West by positioning it as the virtuous entity worth defending and suggesting that supporting Ukraine is inherently about safeguarding Western civilization itself."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism. Run your eye down the contributors to The Climate Book and you can see who she’s been reading: Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Naomi Klein. For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the climate movement, specifically through Greta Thunberg and her influences, as being driven by a radical anti-capitalist and social justice ideology rather than genuine environmental concern, challenging the movement's motives and integrity."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the climate agenda is not a genuine environmental effort but a tool for advancing a specific (radical left) political ideology, framing green policies as instruments for broader geopolitical or ideological power struggles."
    }
  ],
  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'human alarm bell' and 'climate Cassandra' directly frames Thunberg and, by extension, the climate movement she represents, as exaggerating and being alarmist for dramatic effect."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto.",
      "reasoning": "The word 'demented' is a direct personal attack on Greta Thunberg's mental state and the substance of her advocacy, attacking her reputation rather than her arguments."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by alleging its true goal is not environmental protection but the advancement of a radical leftist political ideology, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or a direct ad hominem attack on a key figure."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Normal” was the “system” which gave us the climate crisis, a system of “colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide”, of “racist, oppressive extractionism”.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly frames the climate crisis and the system that caused it as being rooted in colonialism and imperialism, suggesting that addressing climate issues is inherently about confronting these historical and ongoing exploitative power structures, aligning with the definition of green activities as a form of neo-colonialism."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote characterizes a major international climate forum (COP) as a deceptive and exploitative mechanism, directly criticizing international climate relations as abusive and not operating in good faith."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This concluding statement explicitly frames the climate movement's ultimate goal as a geopolitical instrument to destroy Western civilization and replace it with a hostile ideology. It supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments, but the specific argument—that it's a cover for a civilizational war and ideological takeover—is not captured by the more specific subnarratives provided."

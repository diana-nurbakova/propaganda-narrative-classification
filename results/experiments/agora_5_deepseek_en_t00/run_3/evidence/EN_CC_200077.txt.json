      "evidence_quote": "By depriving rural residents of their right to just say no to green energy scams, the state-level 'greenies' who control California, Illinois, Michigan and New York are pandering to corporate interests while lining their own pockets, all at the expense of their constituents.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the motives and implementation of state-level green energy policies, framing them as 'scams' that serve corporate and political interests rather than the public good, which aligns with the definition of questioning the effectiveness and motives behind climate policies."

      "reasoning": "This quote, attributed to a cited source, challenges the motives and integrity of the climate/renewables movement by alleging it has been corrupted by corporate financial interests, which aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement."

      "evidence_quote": "Green energy is a scam that benefits communist China and other foreign interests at the expense of American energy independence.",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses strong skepticism and criticism of green energy technologies, labeling them a 'scam' and linking them to geopolitical adversaries, which fits the narrative of controversy about green technologies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Green energy is a scam that benefits communist China and other foreign interests at the expense of American energy independence.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly claims that green energy policies serve the interests of foreign powers (specifically China) and undermine national energy independence, framing them as tools for geopolitical influence rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "evidence_quote": "By depriving rural residents of their right to just say no to green energy scams, the state-level 'greenies' who control California, Illinois, Michigan and New York are pandering to corporate interests while lining their own pockets, all at the expense of their constituents.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that climate policies (green energy projects) are driven by corporate interests and personal financial gain ('lining their own pockets'), which aligns with the definition of policies being driven by profit rather than genuine environmental concerns."

      "evidence_quote": "All that taxpayer cash being pumped into the green economy, supposedly to fight not just inflation but also climate change, is being used to drive family farmers off their land so it can be turned into another wind or solar farm, or perhaps the next carbon capture pipeline.",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that climate policy funding (the Inflation Reduction Act) leads to the negative economic outcome of displacing family farmers and taking their land, harming local agricultural economies."

      "evidence_quote": "Green energy is a scam that benefits communist China and other foreign interests at the expense of American energy independence.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by framing them as a 'scam' that harms national interests and benefits foreign adversaries. This argument does not fit the definitions of being ineffective, economically harmful, or profit-driven in the specific ways defined, but it is a distinct criticism of the policies' geopolitical and security outcomes."

      "evidence_quote": "Many states where rural farmers now face assault by the green industry are taking advantage of the Biden regime's Inflation Reduction Act, which exists to help multinational corporations at the expense of mom-and-pop America.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the national government (the 'Biden regime') for enacting a policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) that is portrayed as harming American citizens to benefit corporations, fitting the definition of disapproval of how a national government handles climate-related policy."

      "evidence_quote": "Local governments in these four left-leaning states no longer have authority over their own land when it comes to the green projects being pushed by state-level bureaucrats, many of whom have sold their souls to 'renewable' energy projects involving wind and solar.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes state-level bureaucratic institutions and authorities for overriding local control and being corrupt, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit neatly into the more specific subcategories of national governments, EU, international entities, or political figures alone."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "By depriving rural residents of their right to just say no to green energy scams, the state-level 'greenies' who control California, Illinois, Michigan and New York are pandering to corporate interests while lining their own pockets, all at the expense of their constituents.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly alleges that the climate movement (referred to as 'greenies') is driven by corruption, specifically by pandering to corporate interests and personal financial gain ('lining their own pockets'), which matches the definition of the 'corrupt' subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames the climate action as an exaggerated or false crisis ('supposedly to fight... climate change') used to justify harmful and extreme measures (driving farmers off their land), which aligns with the 'alarmist' subnarrative definition of suggesting the movement exaggerates severity for effect."

      "evidence_quote": "Green energy is a scam that benefits communist China and other foreign interests at the expense of American energy independence.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement by labeling its core solution ('green energy') as a 'scam' that harms national interests. This argument does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks on key activists', so it qualifies as 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies by framing them as a 'scam' driven by corruption and corporate greed, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific subnarratives about danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "Green energy is a scam that benefits communist China and other foreign interests at the expense of American energy independence.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames green energy policies as an instrument that benefits foreign powers (specifically China) to the detriment of the United States, characterizing the international dynamic as exploitative and abusive to American interests."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All that taxpayer cash being pumped into the green economy, supposedly to fight not just inflation but also climate change, is being used to drive family farmers off their land so it can be turned into another wind or solar farm, or perhaps the next carbon capture pipeline.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by depicting them as a tool for domestic economic exploitation and land seizure, funded by taxpayers. While it criticizes domestic actors, it reinforces the idea that these policies are instruments of control and exploitation, which is a core theme of the parent narrative not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives about international relations or neo-colonialism."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific climate policy (the Green New Deal) by highlighting its political opposition and electoral failure, suggesting it is not achieving its intended goals, which aligns with the definition of policies being ineffective."

      "evidence_quote": "The C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action – it’s a chance to elevate the solutions cities are deploying at a neighborhood level that have a real impact on people’s daily lives.",
      "reasoning": "The article frames the summit and Garcetti's participation as hypocritical and performative, implying the event and the mayor's travel are for show or personal/political gain rather than genuine environmental action, which fits the narrative that such policies and actions are driven by motives other than genuine concern."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the method of participation (flying) as hypocritical and counterproductive to the stated climate goals, and criticizes the mayor for neglecting local issues. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies/actors but does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Mayor Eric Garcetti's performance and legacy, focusing on domestic failures (crime, homelessness) and a political crisis within his party, thereby discrediting him as a political figure in the context of his climate-focused trip."

      "reasoning": "This statement expresses disapproval of the decision-making and actions of the authorities (the summit organizers and/or Garcetti) by questioning the necessity of the in-person event, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit the specific definitions targeting the EU, international entities, national governments, or political organizations/figures."

      "evidence_quote": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined a “global coalition of mayors” at a summit on climate change this week in Buenos Aires, Argentina, burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights hypocrisy and ulterior motives by suggesting the mayor's actions (flying internationally) contradict the stated goals of the climate movement, implying the movement is not sincere and is engaged in corrupt or unethical practices like virtue signaling."

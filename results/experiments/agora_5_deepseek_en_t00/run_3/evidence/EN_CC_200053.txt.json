      "reasoning": "This quote frames climate action (attending COP27) as being in potential conflict with domestic economic priorities, implicitly questioning the immediate effectiveness or priority of climate policies when faced with economic challenges."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the UK government's competence and consistency on climate policy, highlighting reversals on fracking and the demotion of key climate officials, which challenges the authority's commitment and integrity."

      "evidence_quote": "The prime minister told reporters on Friday said he was “very passionate” about the environment, but would focus on “the depressing domestic challenges we have with the economy” for the time being.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames climate action (attending COP27) as being in conflict with addressing pressing economic issues, implying that focusing on climate policies could detract from solving economic problems, which aligns with the subnarrative that such policies have a negative economic impact."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the government's climate policy approach by highlighting inconsistency and demoting key climate officials. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of being ineffective, economically harmful, or profit-driven; it instead suggests political inconsistency and deprioritization."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the UK government's inconsistent and seemingly unserious approach to climate policy, highlighting policy reversals and the demotion of key climate officials, which fits the definition of disapproving of how national governments handle climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "The U-turn comes after Sunak came under pressure from climate activists, opposition parties, and some Conservative MPs including his former boss Boris Johnson and the government’s climate czar Alok Sharma, for his planned absence.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the Prime Minister's decision to attend COP27 as a reluctant reversal forced by pressure, implicitly criticizing his initial judgment and leadership on the issue, which discredits a political figure in the context of the climate debate."

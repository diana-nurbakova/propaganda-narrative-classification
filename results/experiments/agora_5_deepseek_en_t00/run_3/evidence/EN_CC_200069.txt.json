      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the destruction of 'street zone sectioning barriers' as a positive act of resistance, directly criticizing the specific climate or urban policy (like low-traffic neighborhoods) that implemented them, questioning their effectiveness and public acceptance."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' is a direct and pejorative challenge to the climate movement, framing its goals and actions as irrational and extreme, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing the movement's motives and impact."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate change as 'The Climate Con' (a con or fraud) fundamentally downplays its significance and scientific reality, suggesting it is a deception rather than a genuine crisis."

      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate policies as irrational and misguided, implying they are not a sensible or effective response to climate issues."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast. Or you can make a donation here.",
      "reasoning": "The text labels climate action as 'The Climate Con' (a con implying a scam) and directly solicits financial support to fight it, suggesting the climate agenda is a fraudulent scheme for profit."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "This describes direct, illegal civil disobedience against a specific climate policy (traffic restrictions), which criticizes the policy's imposition and social acceptability but does not directly address its effectiveness, economic impact, or profit motive as defined in the other subnarratives."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames the climate movement's agenda as irrational and hysterical, aligning with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist and exaggerating the issue."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "The repeated labeling of climate action as 'The Climate Con' directly alleges that the climate movement is a fraudulent scheme or scam, implying corruption and ulterior motives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s very inspiring to see the people of the UK take matters into their own hands. This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly supports the parent narrative by celebrating and encouraging active resistance against the climate movement, which is a form of criticism not specifically covered by the 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem' subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate change policies as irrational or extreme, which is a form of downplaying the seriousness and legitimacy of climate change, but does not fit any of the more specific scientific denial subnarratives provided."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023.",
      "reasoning": "Promoting disobedience against climate policies implicitly downplays the urgency and necessity of those policies, supporting the parent narrative of downplaying climate change without matching a specific scientific subnarrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con",
      "reasoning": "Labeling climate change as a 'Con' (short for confidence trick or scam) directly dismisses it as a fraudulent concept, which is a core argument for downplaying climate change but is not captured by the specific scientific denial subnarratives listed."

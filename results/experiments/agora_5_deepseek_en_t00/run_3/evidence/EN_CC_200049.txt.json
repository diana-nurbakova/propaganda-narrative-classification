      "evidence_quote": "The group’s assertion that in the U.S. most weather-related deaths “are caused by heat” does not stand up to scrutiny, however, since the majority of weather-related deaths come from cold, not heat.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the severity of a climate change impact (heat-related deaths) by presenting alternative data to minimize the problem's significance."

      "evidence_quote": "According to data published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), over the past twenty years annual heat-related deaths in the U.S. have ranged between 0.9 and 3.6 per million people whereas cold-related deaths have ranged between 3.6 and 5.9 per million people.",
      "reasoning": "The text uses selective data from an official source (EPA) to cast doubt on the scientific claim (from Science Alert) about the leading cause of weather-related deaths, thereby questioning the evidence base for climate alarmism."

      "evidence_quote": "The UK-based Lancet medical journal, which regularly laments the dire consequences of climate change, published a study in 2021...",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'regularly laments the dire consequences' frames the journal (and by extension, the climate science community it represents) as biased or alarmist, challenging the integrity and objectivity of the climate movement's messaging."

      "evidence_quote": "According to the Lancet, people around the world are 9.4 times more likely to die from the cold than from the heat. It added that over the past 20 years, the death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the net mortality impact of climate change is minimal or even beneficial, as cold-related deaths are far more common and have decreased more than heat-related deaths have increased, thereby downplaying the significance of the temperature increase."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges a specific claim made by climate advocates (about heat being the leading cause of weather deaths) to undermine the perceived urgency and severity of climate change impacts, supporting the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but not fitting a more specific subnarrative definition."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the reliability of the claim about heat-related deaths being the leading cause, implying the methodology or metric used to support the climate change narrative is flawed and not supported by the data."

      "reasoning": "This quote uses data to downplay the impact of global warming, suggesting the net effect on mortality is beneficial (cold deaths decreasing more than heat deaths increase), which implicitly questions the severity or even the existence of harmful temperature increases as claimed."

      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'Alarmists' in the headline is a general pejorative that supports the parent narrative of questioning climate science by dismissing those who promote it as exaggerators, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "The opening headline uses the term 'Alarmists' to label those warning about the heat dome and climate change, framing their warnings as exaggerated or fear-mongering, which directly matches the definition of the subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes a factual claim made by the climate movement (represented by Science Alert), arguing it is factually incorrect. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.' It is a distinct form of criticism based on disputing data."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the actions and methods of climate activists, framing them as 'alarmists' whose vandalism is causing public annoyance, which aligns with the narrative of challenging the motives, integrity, or impact of the climate movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly criticizes the climate movement's public relations strategy, suggesting its actions are counterproductive and damaging to its own cause, which fits the definition of challenging the movement's impact and integrity."

      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical '(it's not)' directly dismisses the legitimacy of man-made climate change as a threat, which is a clear statement minimizing the significance of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This phrase suggests that concerns about global warming are exaggerated ('exploited') and that its predicted impacts do not come true ('never seem to materialize'), thereby downplaying the reality and urgency of climate change."

It's impossible to understand the logic behind the focus on an ancient site created thousands of year before the development of carbon based energy. However, climate activists seem to be more concerned with media coverage than making sense.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement's tactics as illogical, counterproductive, and primarily driven by a desire for media attention rather than genuine environmental concern. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

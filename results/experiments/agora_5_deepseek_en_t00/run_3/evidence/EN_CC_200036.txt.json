      "evidence_quote": "Climate cultists push bizarre scare language about weather: “rain bombs” and “boiling oceans”",
      "reasoning": "The opening phrase 'Climate cultists' is a derogatory term that challenges the integrity and motives of the climate movement, framing its language as 'bizarre' and 'scare' tactics."

      "evidence_quote": "\"That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers, and the rain bombs, and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level, and causing these waves of climate refugees, predicted to reach one billion in this century.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quoted statement from Al Gore, presented in the text, lists a catastrophic chain of consequences (boiling oceans, droughts, sea level rise, a billion refugees) which serves to emphasize and amplify fears about climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "The legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for \"renewable energy,\" meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the Inflation Reduction Act's climate policy by sarcastically equating investment in renewables with a 'very dark and cold future for humanity,' questioning the effectiveness and outcome of the policy."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "\"I have been hearing about these end of the world scenarios since I was a kid. And not one of their predictions has come true. Global cooling, global warming, mass extinction, mass famine, the polar ice caps melting, mass flooding, the ozone layer depleted, etc.\"",
      "reasoning": "This commenter's statement minimizes the significance of climate change by claiming past predictions have consistently failed, thereby suggesting the current climate crisis is not a legitimate threat."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Renewable energy ... is now the cheapest source of electricity in almost the entire planet,\" Gore lied.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly labels Gore's statement about renewable energy cost as a lie, expressing skepticism and criticism towards the claims made about green technology."

      "reasoning": "The opening phrase directly frames the climate movement's terminology as exaggerated and fear-mongering, labeling it 'bizarre scare language,' which aligns with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist."

      "reasoning": "This quote attacks Al Gore's personal credibility and character by highlighting his alleged hypocrisy and lavish lifestyle, which is a direct ad hominem attack on a key climate activist figure."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Renewable energy ... is now the cheapest source of electricity in almost the entire planet,' Gore lied.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly accuses a key activist of lying, which is a criticism of the movement's honesty and methods. It supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem' subnarratives as defined, as it is a specific accusation of falsehood rather than a general claim of corruption or a personal character attack beyond the act of lying itself."

      "reasoning": "This quote presents a catastrophic chain of events (boiling oceans, droughts, sea level rise) leading to a massive displacement of one billion people, which fits the definition of presenting intense catastrophic scenarios as results of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This statement uses the extreme analogy of daily atomic bomb explosions to quantify and amplify the fear associated with the heat trapped by greenhouse gases, directly speculating on a terrifying side effect of global warming."

      "reasoning": "This quote, presented by the article's author via a commenter, directly supports the parent narrative by framing climate communication as using 'scary new names' to 'frighten the general public.' This manipulative tactic aligns with amplifying climate fears but does not fit the specific definitions of the other subnarratives (e.g., it's not about uninhabitability, doomsday for humans, or futility)."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the communication and rhetoric of climate advocates as alarmist and manipulative ('scare language'), which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the definitions of the three specific economic, effectiveness, or profit-driven subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change by dismissing climate concerns as failed alarmist predictions, but it does not align with any of the specific scientific denial subnarratives provided (e.g., natural cycles, human impact, sea levels). It is a general argument against the credibility of climate warnings."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames renewable energy investment as a massive, wasteful expenditure that will lead to a negative outcome ('dark and cold future'), aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive and not worth adopting."

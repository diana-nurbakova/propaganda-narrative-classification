      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the scientific basis for claims about long-term temperature records by highlighting the limited timeframe of direct data collection, casting doubt on the methods used to extend the record back thousands of years."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses a NASA statement to question the validity and comparability of paleoclimate proxy data, which is central to the claims being criticized, thereby sowing doubt about the scientific consensus on historical temperatures."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely “the hottest day in thousands of years.”",
      "reasoning": "The term 'climate alarmists' is a pejorative label that challenges the motives and credibility of those raising climate concerns, framing their assertions as exaggerated and alarmist rather than scientifically grounded."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert that 2024 is “the planet’s hottest year yet since at least the pre-industrial era, and likely for at least 100,000 years before that” (emphasis added).",
      "reasoning": "Describing the claims as 'extravagant' directly criticizes the climate movement for making what the author implies are unsupported or hyperbolic statements, challenging their integrity and impact."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by questioning the validity of long-term climate claims based on the limited duration of the instrumental record. It does not fit the other specific subnarratives, as it is not about flawed methodology, specific data showing no increase, or the greenhouse effect, but rather a broader skepticism about the possibility of knowing long-term trends."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by casting doubt on the claims of historical temperature extremes, but its argument—that the claims are invalid because direct measurement records are too short—does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "The text opens by labeling those making climate claims as 'alarmists' and frames their statements about record heat as lamentations, directly suggesting the movement exaggerates severity for dramatic effect."

      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question dismissively implies the climate movement's narrative is unscientific and driven by a desire for a compelling 'story' rather than facts. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "reasoning": "The opening phrase 'Climate alarmists' is a pejorative label, and the description of their claims as 'lamenting' and the use of scare quotes around 'the hottest day in thousands of years' frames the climate movement as exaggerating and being overly dramatic."

      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes and portrays Western nations as acting with malicious intent and recklessness, undermining their diplomatic and military posture."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly attacks the integrity and motives of Western media, labeling them as 'filthy pro-imperialist' to undermine their credibility."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames Russia's potential military actions as a justified and defensive response to NATO expansion, portraying Russia as a victim of Western encirclement."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",

      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts the responsibility for the conflict and its escalation to the United States and its European allies, portraying them as deliberately seeking war, which aligns with the definition of blaming the West as the aggressors."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago... Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.",
      "reasoning": "This frames the current crisis as a consequence of Western (NATO) expansion and military posturing, portraying NATO's actions as the primary threat and source of conflict, thus blaming the West for the aggressive situation."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This statement suggests Ukraine, with US backing, is planning a 'false-flag' operation, thereby portraying Ukraine as an active, aggressive participant in escalating the conflict rather than a victim of invasion."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others (the US media and, by extension, the US establishment) but does not fit neatly into the 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' subnarratives. It presents a distinct motive (domestic distraction) for US actions leading to war."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses Western governments and media of fabricating and exaggerating the threat of a Russian invasion without evidence, framing their reaction as disproportionate and alarmist."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that Western support for Ukraine is not genuine concern for the country, but rather a 'pretext' for their own geopolitical confrontation with Russia, disregarding Ukraine's fate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted. It writes: 'With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.'",
      "reasoning": "The text cites and endorses the view that the window for diplomacy is closing or was never open, discrediting the potential for diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western motives, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives. It presents Western actions as a cynical ploy to distract from domestic problems, which is a distinct argument not covered by the other definitions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses specific Western media outlets (NYT, WaPo) of being part of a deliberate disinformation campaign, presenting lies as fact to manipulate public opinion, which matches the definition of Western media as an instrument of propaganda."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly discredits media across the Atlantic as 'filthy pro-imperialist,' supporting the parent narrative of distrust towards media. It does not specifically target Ukrainian media, nor does it solely focus on the instrumental propaganda role; it is a general, pejorative dismissal that constitutes distinct evidence beyond the specific subnarrative."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence",
      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Russia's posture and potential actions as a necessary and justified response to an external threat (NATO expansion), portraying them as defensive rather than aggressive."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western (specifically US) media and political actions are not based on genuine security concerns but on internal dysfunction and a desire for conflict, implying a deep-seated, irrational hostility or agenda against Russia."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses Ukrainian forces, backed by the US, of planning a false-flag operation, portraying Ukraine as an extremist actor actively working against Russia under foreign guidance."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as a victim of Western/NATO overreach and humiliation, forced into a subjugated position, which is a distinct argument not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that NATO should take a more direct and aggressive military action by supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine, which aligns with the subnarrative definition of suggesting NATO ought to or will take direct military action."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by accusing the US and NATO of deliberately seeking war with Russia, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions about WW3, attacks on other countries, nuclear weapons, or direct NATO intervention as defined."

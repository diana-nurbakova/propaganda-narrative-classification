      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the US as the primary actor with a material motive for the conflict, shifting the focus and implied blame for the war's continuation away from Russia's invasion and onto Western economic interests."

'The fate of the colonies is always the same: the Americans will scoop up all the natural resources of Ukraine in exchange for 'the great honor of being a friend of the United States''",
      "reasoning": "The text, through the Russian official's statement, directly criticizes and discredits Western (specifically US) intentions, portraying them as colonialist and exploitative rather than supportive."

      "evidence_quote": "'Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the legitimacy of the Ukrainian government by labeling it as both 'corrupt' and a 'neo-Nazi regime', which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the US/West's motivation for involvement in the war as securing access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, shifting the responsibility for the conflict's continuation and escalation from Russia to the West's economic interests."

      "reasoning": "This quote, attributed to a Russian official, explicitly characterizes Western (specifically US) actions as colonial exploitation, portraying the West as the aggressor seeking to plunder Ukraine rather than Russia as the invading force."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others (the West) but introduces additional, distinct themes not covered by the specific subnarratives: it combines the idea of Western colonial exploitation with accusations of supporting a 'corrupt neo-Nazi regime' in Kyiv, which is a separate argument for shifting blame away from Russia."

      "evidence_quote": "“They’re sitting on 10 to $12 trillion of critical minerals in Ukraine. They could be the richest country in all of Europe... If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames Western support for Ukraine as being motivated by access to valuable mineral resources rather than genuine concern for Ukraine's sovereignty or people, portraying the West as self-interested."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying the US as a colonial power exploiting Ukraine, but it introduces additional specific elements (corrupt neo-Nazi regime) not covered by the other defined subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote questions the economic impact and feasibility of the policy by highlighting the unknown financial burden on taxpayers, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing climate policies for their potential negative economic consequences."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses skepticism and criticism of the green technology transition by associating it with foreign, politically contentious entities, suggesting the technology or its implementation is problematic."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the green energy policy (EV battery plants) as being entangled with a foreign geopolitical power (China/CCP), implying the policy is a tool for or is influenced by geopolitical interests rather than purely environmental ones."

      "reasoning": "This quote highlights an unknown financial burden on taxpayers, framing the policy as potentially costly and economically risky, which aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies negatively impact the economy."

      "reasoning": "This quote, and the subsequent discussion of specific Chinese corporate investments, suggests the policy is driven by foreign corporate and political interests rather than genuine environmental benefit, fitting the 'only for profit' subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the policy by highlighting strong local opposition and political consequences, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but not fitting neatly into the more specific economic or profit-driven subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly highlights the unknown financial burden of the transition, framing it as a potentially expensive and risky undertaking for taxpayers, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable/green technologies are costly."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This argument introduces a geopolitical and security risk associated with the green energy transition (ties to the CCP), which supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies but does not fit the definitions of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links the state's green energy policy (electrifying the fleet) to foreign investment from China, framing it as an 'entanglement' with a foreign political power, which aligns with the subnarrative that green initiatives are a vehicle for external control and influence, akin to neo-colonialism."

      "evidence_quote": "Gotion Inc., linked to the CCP, plans to build a $2.4 billion EV battery plant in the Big Rapids, Michigan, area at Whitmer’s behest.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by highlighting a specific instance where a climate-related industrial project (an EV battery plant) is tied to a foreign geopolitical actor (the CCP). It does not fit the 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions precisely, as it focuses on domestic investment with foreign ties rather than explicit international exploitation or control of developing nations."

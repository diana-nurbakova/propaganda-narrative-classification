      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the effectiveness and environmental impact of a specific climate policy (wind farm development), framing it as contradictory ('green energy' in quotes) and destructive, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lists multiple negative consequences (deforestation, wildlife harm, reliance on problematic mining) associated with wind turbines, expressing clear skepticism and criticism of this green technology."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), Mairi Gougeon, has admitted that some 15.7 million trees were cut down...",
      "reasoning": "The text uses loaded, pejorative terms ('leftist-separatist locally-devolved') to describe the Scottish government, challenging its competence and motives in managing environmental policy, which fits the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "This quote connects a green technology (wind turbines) to dependency on a geopolitical rival ('Communist China'), implying the policy has strategic vulnerabilities and serves interests beyond environmentalism, aligning with the narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the wind farm policy as environmentally counterproductive by highlighting the destruction of a large number of trees, which are natural carbon sinks, to build 'green' infrastructure. This suggests the policy fails to achieve its intended environmental goals, as it causes significant ecological harm."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "“I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'damage to... business' as a concern raised by rural communities regarding wind farm developments, directly linking the climate policy to negative economic outcomes for local enterprises."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes climate policies (wind farms) by highlighting severe negative social and environmental consequences in the supply chain (human suffering, pollution in China) that are not covered by the other specific subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but introduces a distinct theme of global human cost and dependency on foreign regimes."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that the production of wind turbines relies on a process (mining rare earth minerals) that causes severe health and environmental damage, framing renewable energy as dangerous to human health and local ecosystems."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "responding to the letter, Mr Kerr said: “Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,” adding that the government “must be alive” to the “significant costs” of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions the \"significant costs\" associated with wind turbine installation, framing the development as having a high, perhaps hidden, price that the public should be aware of, aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by framing the green energy push as hypocritical or counterproductive (destroying trees for 'green' energy) and uses politically charged language ('leftist', 'supposedly') to criticize the motivation behind the technology. This argument does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy, as it focuses on environmental trade-offs and political ideology."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the actions and policies of the Scottish national government, portraying its 'green energy' push as hypocritical and destructive, which fits the definition of disapproving of how a national government handles climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "The Rural Affairs Secretary for the leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), Mairi Gougeon, has admitted that some 15.7 million trees were cut down...",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') and singles out a specific political party (SNP) and its representative, discrediting them in the context of the climate change debate."

      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the broader institutional push for wind energy (a policy supported by authorities) by highlighting negative environmental and social consequences not covered by the specific subnarratives of criticizing governments or political figures. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities through a distinct line of argument."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links Western 'green' wind energy projects to exploitative and harmful mining practices in China, framing the pursuit of renewable energy as a form of externalizing environmental and health costs onto a developing nation, which aligns with the definition of neo-colonialism where developed countries exert control and cause harm to others for their own benefit."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the Scottish government's green energy policy as hypocritical and destructive, suggesting that the policy is not genuinely environmental but rather a politically motivated instrument ('green madness') that causes significant local environmental damage. This supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical/instrumental, but the specific argument about domestic hypocrisy and destruction does not fit the 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions."

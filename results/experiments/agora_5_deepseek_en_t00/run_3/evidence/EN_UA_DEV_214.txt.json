      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes and delegitimizes NATO, portraying it as an outdated and aggressive tool of American foreign policy, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Western institutions and diplomacy."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China. So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict... it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "This statement shifts the blame for the war's continuation and enabling away from Russia (the invader) and onto China and the West, suggesting they are responsible for the conflict rather than Russia's initial invasion."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's war effort and government by portraying it as callously sacrificing its own citizens, which attacks the legitimacy and actions of the Ukrainian state."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear by predicting the conflict's expansion into a third world war, which is designed to elicit anxiety about severe global consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This highlights a negative outcome for the West (depleting its own arsenals without achieving victory), which aligns with the narrative of predicting adverse consequences for Western interests."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the reliability and integrity of Western mainstream media and official narratives, framing them as 'nonsense' believed only by a select few, thereby undermining confidence in these media sources."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly states that the West is willing to prolong the war in Ukraine for its own strategic benefit (expanding to Asia), showing a callous disregard for Ukrainian lives, which are treated as expendable ('just Ukrainian lives after all')."

      "reasoning": "This statement presents the West's military effort in Ukraine as a failure despite massive investment ('emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning'), portraying it as a non-potent, ineffective force."

      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying NATO not as a legitimate defensive alliance but as an aggressive, expansionist tool. This specific argument—that a key Western diplomatic/military institution is inherently aggressive and obsolete—does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West for prolonging and expanding the war, and also blames Ukraine ('Kyiv') for its conduct, which is a form of blaming others for the war's nature but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as cleanly. It is a distinct, additional argument shifting blame away from the invader."

      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'just Ukrainian lives after all' and the depiction of forced conscription as 'cannon fodder' frames the conflict as a futile war of attrition with no positive outcome for Ukraine, portraying the situation as hopeless."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'proxy war' frames the conflict in Ukraine as a war fought by Ukraine on behalf of Western powers, implying Ukraine is not an independent actor but a puppet or instrument of the West."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a third world war, framing the conflict's expansion as a deliberate act of globalizing war, which aligns with the subnarrative of warning against actions that risk WW3."

      "evidence_quote": "But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition, then expand it to Asia.",
      "reasoning": "The statement explicitly claims that the war will be expanded from Eastern Europe to Asia, implying an imminent threat of conflict spreading to other countries, which matches the subnarrative definition."

      "evidence_quote": "Alarmingly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Nato as playing a “bridge” between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific theatres.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests NATO is positioning itself to take a direct, expanded role by bridging conflicts in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, implying a shift towards direct intervention in a broader theater."

      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by accusing the West of scapegoating China to justify and prolong the conflict, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting the specific definitions of the other subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western military support for Ukraine is depleting their own arsenals and failing to achieve victory, which catastrophizes the negative, self-harming consequences of their actions."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western/American actions are leading to catastrophic global consequences, specifically the risk of a third world war, which is a negative consequence for the West and the world that is not covered by the more specific subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly equates Western mainstream newsrooms with the corridors of power, framing them as part of a 'disinformation war' and suggesting their output ('all that nonsense') is not credible propaganda rather than independent journalism."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Given his obvious mental decline, US President Joe Biden may be forgiven for claiming to ABC News’ host George Stephanopoulos that he was indispensable: “You know, not only am I campaigning, but I’m running the world.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits a specific Western media outlet (ABC News) and its interview by framing the host as a platform for a leader portrayed as mentally unfit, implying the media is complicit in disseminating false or delusional claims, which supports the broader narrative of media distrust beyond the specific definitions provided."

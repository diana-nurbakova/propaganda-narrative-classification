      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Zelensky wants Ukraine destroyed. There’s no sugar coating it.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly delegitimizes the Ukrainian president, portraying him as malicious and intent on the destruction of his own country, which fits the definition of discrediting government officials."

      "evidence_quote": "This is a perfect example of how censorship leads to destruction.",
      "reasoning": "This claim supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by alleging that internal Ukrainian policies (censorship) are a direct cause of its downfall. This argument does not fit neatly into any of the other specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West by arguing that Western/NATO support is ineffective propaganda, leading to Ukraine's destruction. It does not cleanly fit a more specific subnarrative like 'The West is weak' (which is about potency, not intent) or 'Diplomacy does not work' (not discussed), but it clearly aims to discredit Western actions and narratives regarding Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that after Ukraine, NATO will target other countries for destruction, implying an imminent and expanding threat from Russia's perspective, which aligns with the subnarrative of warning that Russia will attack other countries."

      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by framing NATO as an existential, world-destroying threat that must be preemptively destroyed. It supports the parent narrative of amplifying fears but does not fit the specific definitions of fearing WW3, nuclear use, or direct NATO intervention; instead, it presents a catastrophic, apocalyptic vision of the conflict's escalation."

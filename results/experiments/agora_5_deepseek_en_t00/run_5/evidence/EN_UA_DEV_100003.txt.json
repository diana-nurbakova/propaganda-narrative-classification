      "evidence_quote": "\"Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote is a direct prediction about the potential future capture of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, by Russian forces, which fits the definition of speculating about war outcomes."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement glorifies Russia's territorial ambitions and asserts a historical and cultural claim over Odesa, portraying its potential capture as a positive and rightful return, which constitutes praise of Russia's actions and goals."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "On the eve of its second anniversary, Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's, and a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests a decline in Ukrainian military effectiveness and strength by stating they are 'outnumbered and outgunned' and facing a critical shortage of external aid, which supports the subnarrative of the Ukrainian army collapsing."

      "evidence_quote": "Russian troops will go much further into Ukraine, taking the southern city of Odesa and might even one day push on to the capital Kyiv, a senior ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on future war outcomes, specifically predicting significant Russian territorial gains (Odesa and Kyiv). It supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes but does not fit the specific definitions of 'Russian army is collapsing', 'Russian army will lose all occupied territories', or 'Ukrainian army is collapsing' (which is already identified). It is a distinct, speculative claim about Russian success."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian troops will go much further into Ukraine, taking the southern city of Odesa and might even one day push on to the capital Kyiv",
      "reasoning": "This statement projects confidence in the future offensive capabilities and expansion of the Russian military, positively highlighting its potential scale and reach."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin said Tuesday that Russian troops would push further into Ukraine to build on their success on the battlefield after the weekend fall of the town of Avdiivka where he said Ukrainian troops had been forced to flee in chaos.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Putin as a decisive leader announcing and building on military successes, presenting his strategic vision positively."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,\" Medvedev said.",
      "reasoning": "This statement portrays Russia's territorial ambitions as a benevolent 'homecoming' for a city, framing Russian control as a natural and positive outcome for its people, aligning with the idea of Russia providing prosperity and unity."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Russian invasion has strong national support",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict.",
      "reasoning": "This statement, while from the article's author, interprets Medvedev's hawkish stance as reflective of a broader confidence within the Russian leadership and, by implication, national support for the war's progression."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia says the territory its forces control is part of Russia and that it will never be given up.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by presenting Russia's position as resolute and justified, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about military might, Putin, peace/prosperity, or support). It is a distinct argument legitimizing Russia's territorial claims."

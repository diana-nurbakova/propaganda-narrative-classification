      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "After multiple instances of vandalism against famous landmarks and artistic works of western cultural significance, many people are growing annoyed with the actions of climate alarmists.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the actions and methods of climate activists, framing them as 'alarmists' whose vandalism is causing public annoyance, which aligns with the narrative of challenging the motives, integrity, or impact of the climate movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly criticizes the climate movement's public relations strategy, suggesting its actions are counterproductive and damaging to its own cause, which fits the definition of challenging the impact of the movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical '(it's not)' directly dismisses the legitimacy of man-made climate change as a threat, which is a clear statement minimizing the significance of climate change."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase suggests that predictions related to global warming (a core aspect of climate change) are exaggerated and fail to come true, thereby downplaying the reality and impact of climate change."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Less than half of Americans believe climate change is caused by human activity.",
      "reasoning": "By citing polling data on public belief, the text implicitly raises doubt about the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary driver of climate change, suggesting the science is not settled or widely accepted."

It's impossible to understand the logic behind the focus on an ancient site created thousands of year before the development of carbon based energy. However, climate activists seem to be more concerned with media coverage than making sense.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement's tactics as illogical, counterproductive, and primarily driven by a desire for media attention rather than genuine environmental concern. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks' as defined."

It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about methodologies, data, or the scientific community's reliability, as it is a broad dismissal of the foundational premise."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism... For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Greta Thunberg and her associated thinkers as having a hidden, radical political agenda (anti-capitalism, de-growth) that goes beyond genuine environmental concern, challenging the motives and integrity of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly claims that the climate movement's true goal is not environmental protection but the geopolitical and ideological destruction of Western civilization, framing green policies as a tool for this purpose."
    }

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'human alarm bell' and 'climate Cassandra' directly frames Greta Thunberg and, by extension, the climate movement she represents, as figures defined by alarmism and exaggerated warnings."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto.",
      "reasoning": "The word 'demented' is a direct personal attack on Greta Thunberg's mental state and the substance of her advocacy, attacking her reputation rather than her arguments."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "Labeling the COP (Conference of the Parties) climate meetings a 'scam' that facilitates dishonesty and deception implies the broader climate movement and its institutional efforts are corrupt and operate with unethical motives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by alleging its true, hidden purpose is not environmental protection but the advancement of a radical left-wing political ideology. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks on a key individual."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Normal” was the “system” which gave us the climate crisis, a system of “colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide”, of “racist, oppressive extractionism”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the climate crisis and the system behind it as rooted in colonialism and imperialism, suggesting that green activism is a response to and a critique of these historical and ongoing exploitative practices, aligning with the definition of green activities being a form of neo-colonialism critique."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a major international climate framework (COP) as a deceptive and exploitative instrument, supporting the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments, but it does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions as it targets the framework's integrity rather than a specific exploitative economic or colonial relationship."

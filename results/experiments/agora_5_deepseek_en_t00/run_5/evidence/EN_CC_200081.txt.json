      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the effectiveness and environmental impact of a specific climate policy (wind farm development), framing it as contradictory ('green madness') and harmful, which aligns with the narrative's definition of criticizing the effectiveness or motives behind climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This quote lists multiple negative consequences (deforestation, wildlife harm, reliance on problematic mining) associated with wind turbines, expressing clear skepticism and criticism of this environmentally friendly technology, fitting the narrative definition."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "The quote connects 'green' wind turbine production to dependency on a geopolitical rival ('Communist China'), implying the policy strengthens a foreign power, which aligns with the narrative that environmental policies are tools for geopolitical influence rather than pure environmental concern."
    },

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP)...",
      "reasoning": "The use of politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') and the overall framing of the Scottish government's actions as hypocritical and damaging challenges the competence and integrity of the governing institution in relation to its climate actions."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses 'supposedly' to cast doubt on the environmental benefit of the wind farms, implying the policy (promoting wind energy) is counterproductive by destroying trees, thus failing to achieve genuine environmental goals."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'damage to... business' as a concern raised by communities affected by wind farm development, directly linking the climate policy to negative economic outcomes."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes climate policies (wind energy) by highlighting severe environmental and human costs (pollution, health issues) associated with the supply chain, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the definitions of 'ineffective', 'bad for economy', or 'only for profit'."

      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that wind turbines cause significant harm, linking them to environmental damage (to wildlife) and severe human health consequences from mining the required minerals, which fits the definition of asserting renewable energy poses significant risks or dangers."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "“Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,” adding that the government “must be alive” to the “significant costs” of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions the 'significant costs' of wind turbine installation, framing the development as having a high price, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive or inefficient."

Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies by highlighting community opposition and concerns about visual impact and damage to business, which are not covered by the specific subnarratives of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the green energy supply chain as exploitative, where the environmental and health costs of mining rare earth minerals for Western wind turbines are borne by local communities in China. This aligns with the definition of neo-colonialism, suggesting developed nations' green initiatives exert control and cause harm in developing regions."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a national government's green policy (mass tree felling for wind farms) as hypocritical and destructive. It supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical/instrumental tools, but the specific critique is about domestic environmental hypocrisy and poor policy trade-offs, not directly about exploitative international relations or neo-colonialism."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly questions the effectiveness and catastrophic consequences of the climate policy advocated by the Just Stop Oil movement, framing it as genocidal."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda. As the end of the biblical age of grace approaches, the world is increasingly coming unhinged, including environmentally as the birth pangs intensify. The theory that climate fanatics have adopted...",
      "reasoning": "The text labels climate activists as 'fanatics' and attributes their beliefs to 'propaganda' and a quasi-religious delusion, challenging the movement's motives and integrity."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This statement minimizes the significance of human-caused climate change by claiming natural sources emit far more greenhouse gases, thereby downplaying the human impact."

      "evidence_quote": "(Related: According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.)",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical reference directly raises doubts about the scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, aligning with narratives that question climate science."

      "evidence_quote": "Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "The text vividly amplifies fears about the consequences of implementing climate policies, predicting apocalyptic societal collapse and mass death."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that implementing the climate policy (stopping oil use) would fail to achieve its intended environmental goal and instead lead to catastrophic human death, framing the policy as fundamentally ineffective and counterproductive."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "On the very first day of an oil- and gas-free world... all homes, businesses, and other structures that rely on either or both of these for light, heat, fuel, or what have you would no longer function.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the cessation of fossil fuel use would cause immediate and total dysfunction of homes and businesses, which is a direct negative economic and societal impact, aligning with the subnarrative that climate policies harm the economy."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the foundational science behind climate policies, arguing they are based on a false premise. This is a distinct argument not covered by the specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'fear of \"boiling oceans\"' uses hyperbolic and dramatic language to characterize the climate movement's warnings as exaggerated and alarmist, suggesting they are creating unfounded panic."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda.",

      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes the climate movement by presenting an extreme, catastrophic consequence of its proposed policy as a logical outcome, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that natural sources (volcanoes) emit far more greenhouse gases than human activities (cars, cattle), thereby arguing that human activities are not the primary driver of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by citing an authority figure to claim there is no scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, which is a form of downplaying the need for climate action. It does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about natural cycles, weather, adaptation, etc.)."

      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the scientific consensus that human emissions are the primary driver of climate change by asserting that natural sources like volcanoes emit far more CO2, thereby questioning the causal link between human-produced greenhouse gases and climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses the statement of a COP28 president to claim there is 'no science' supporting a key climate policy, thereby discrediting the scientific basis and reliability of the broader scientific community's recommendations."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames the scientific concepts of global warming and ocean heating ('melting or boiling') as exaggerated or false beliefs, and directs readers to a source that claims to debunk man-made climate change. It supports the parent narrative by questioning the validity of climate science but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about data, methodology, or the community's reliability)."

      "reasoning": "The text presents an intense catastrophic scenario where implementing the demands of climate protesters would lead to the deaths of billions of people, framing it as a genocidal outcome and the collapse of civilization."

      "reasoning": "The text directly references and amplifies existing fears related to global warming and catastrophic environmental destruction ('boiling oceans') to characterize the beliefs of climate activists, thereby spreading panic about the perceived threat."

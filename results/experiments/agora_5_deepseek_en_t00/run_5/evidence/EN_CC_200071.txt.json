      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of living (housing, fuel, utilities) to green policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American... who warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Biden's policies as a 'globalist green agenda' with harmful consequences, challenging the competence and intentions of the administration and its institutions."

      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment...",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies (wind, solar, biomass), labeling them as inefficient, expensive, and environmentally destructive."

      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions whether green policies weaken national strength and resilience in the context of geopolitical conflict, framing them as instruments that could compromise geopolitical power."

      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring. \"And these elevated prices for essentials factor into price increases for everything else.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of housing, fuel, and utilities to climate policies, arguing they negatively impact the economy by making essential goods and services unaffordable."

      "evidence_quote": "\"These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the promoted renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are environmentally destructive and incapable of meeting energy demands, suggesting the policies promoting them are ineffective at achieving their stated goals."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies on grounds of national security and military preparedness, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific subnarratives of economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "This opening statement directly criticizes the policies of President Biden, a political figure, linking them to negative economic consequences for Americans, which fits the definition of discrediting political figures in the climate debate."

      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes... Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes a specific action by a U.S. government department under the Biden administration, framing it as a coercive policy that increases costs and burdens on citizens, which constitutes disapproval of how the national government handles climate change."

How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?",
      "reasoning": "This quote broadly criticizes 'green policies' for causing widespread economic hardship and national security weakness. While it implicates political figures, its primary target is the policies themselves as an institutional approach, and it introduces a security argument not explicitly covered by the more specific subnarratives, serving as distinct, leftover evidence supporting the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are incapable of meeting the energy demands of the nation or world, which aligns with the definition of unreliability for widespread adoption."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly labels wind, solar, and biomass as 'inefficient and expensive,' directly supporting the subnarrative that renewable energy is too costly."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "BLINDED by MONEY: Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations.",
      "reasoning": "This headline claims wind farms are killing wildlife (eagles and whales), presenting renewable energy as posing significant risks and dangers to the environment."

      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of \"green\" policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This argument directly supports the parent narrative (controversy about green technologies) by blaming green policies for broad affordability crises, but it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives about energy's danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy. It is a distinct, broader criticism of policy consequences."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames the domestic economic consequences of green policies as a national security weakness, implying that these policies are a form of geopolitical self-sabotage that leaves the country vulnerable to adversaries, which aligns with the idea of international climate relations being exploitative or abusive to national strength."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'\"",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist' is used pejoratively to characterize the green agenda as serving international or supranational interests rather than American ones, supporting the parent narrative that green policies are instruments of geopolitical control, though it does not fit neatly into the more specific 'neo-colonialism' or 'abusive relations' subnarratives."

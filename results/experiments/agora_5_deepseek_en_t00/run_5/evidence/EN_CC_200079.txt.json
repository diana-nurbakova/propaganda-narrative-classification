      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames a climate-related policy proposal (reducing laundry frequency) as an infringement on fundamental rights, questioning its rationale and impact on personal freedom, which aligns with criticizing the effectiveness and motives behind climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the World Economic Forum (WEF), accusing it of hypocrisy and of targeting ordinary citizens while protecting elites, which fits the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities in the context of climate change."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests a deliberate, covert agenda by a powerful group (the WEF and associated elites) to use environmental policy as a tool to oppress ordinary citizens, which aligns with the narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups, even though a specific definition was not provided in the list."

      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote, in the context of the article criticizing the WEF's climate guidelines, implies a connection between the WEF's environmental agenda and its alignment with specific geopolitical actors (China), suggesting policies are tools for influence rather than purely environmental concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote contrasts the proposed policy (restricting laundry) with the massive carbon footprint of the elites promoting it, implying the policy is an ineffective and hypocritical approach to addressing climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the WEF's climate policies are designed to protect elite privileges and financial interests ('perks and privileges for billionaires') while imposing burdens on ordinary citizens, suggesting the policies serve a profit/power motive rather than a genuine environmental one."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by framing them as an extreme and absurd infringement on personal rights and basic hygiene, which is a distinct argument not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The text directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and 'ordering' governments, portraying it as an overreaching authority imposing unreasonable climate-related policies on the public."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities (the WEF) but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives. It accuses the WEF of protecting elite privileges while designing policies to strip rights from ordinary citizens, which is a broader criticism of its motives and governance."

      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The text directly attributes the imposition of restrictive lifestyle rules (laundry and clothing purchase limits) to a specific global elite figure (Klaus Schwab) and his organization (the WEF), portraying them as issuing orders to governments, which fits the definition of blaming secretive, powerful global elites for climate agendas."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims the WEF's environmental policy is not genuinely about the environment but is instead a tool to protect elite privileges while stripping rights from ordinary citizens, indicating an ulterior political motive behind the climate action push."

      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups by highlighting elite hypocrisy and a double standard, which reinforces the idea of a secretive agenda but does not directly fit the definitions of 'Blaming global elites' (which is about attribution of the agenda) or 'Climate agenda has hidden motives' (which is about the agenda's purpose). It is a distinct supporting argument about elite behavior."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",

      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing “the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.”",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the WEF's collaboration with China and its global elite as part of a top-down, exploitative system. By highlighting the praise for China's policies and the exclusive, unelected nature of the forum, it suggests green initiatives are a vehicle for a new form of global control and influence by powerful nations and entities over the general populace, aligning with the neo-colonialism definition."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by highlighting hypocrisy and suggesting the policies are not genuine environmental efforts but tools for control. However, it does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions, as its core argument is about elite hypocrisy and the unfair application of rules, which is a distinct supporting argument for the narrative."

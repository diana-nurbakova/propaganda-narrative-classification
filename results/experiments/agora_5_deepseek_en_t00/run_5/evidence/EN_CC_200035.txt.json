      "evidence_quote": "The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the economic impact and feasibility of the policy by highlighting the unknown financial burden on taxpayers, which aligns with the narrative's definition of questioning the effectiveness and economic impact of climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses skepticism and criticism of the green technology (EV battery plants) by associating it with foreign, politically contentious entities, casting doubt on the integrity and security of the initiative."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the green energy investments (EV battery plants) as being entangled with a foreign geopolitical power (China/CCP), suggesting the policies are tools for or influenced by geopolitical interests rather than purely environmental concerns."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights an unknown financial burden on taxpayers, framing the policy as potentially economically irresponsible and negatively impacting public finances."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote, and the subsequent discussion of specific corporate deals, frames the policy as being driven by foreign corporate and political interests (specifically Chinese corporations linked to the CCP) rather than genuine environmental or local economic concerns."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the policy by highlighting strong local opposition and political backlash, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive. It introduces an argument about democratic will and local rejection."

      "evidence_quote": "The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly highlights the unknown and potentially significant financial burden of the transition to electric vehicles, framing it as a costly and uncertain expense for taxpayers, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable/green technology is expensive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This statement introduces a controversy about green technology (EV/battery plants) by associating it with foreign, specifically Chinese, political influence and security concerns. This supports the parent narrative of 'controversy about green technologies' but does not fit the definitions of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy not being climate friendly."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly links the state's green energy policy (electrifying the fleet) to investments involving Chinese corporations tied to the CCP, framing the initiative as a vehicle for foreign (specifically Chinese) influence and control within the state, which aligns with the neo-colonialism subnarrative of external powers exerting control through green initiatives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Similarly, Whitmer has worked with Ford Motor Co. to bring an EV battery plant to Michigan that would include involvement with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) — China’s premiere battery supplier with deep ties to the CCP.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by highlighting the involvement of a Chinese state-linked entity in a key green energy project. It reinforces the theme of geopolitical entanglement but does not fit the specific 'neo-colonialism' definition as neatly, as it focuses on partnership and involvement rather than explicit control or exploitation of a developing nation. It is distinct evidence supporting the parent narrative."

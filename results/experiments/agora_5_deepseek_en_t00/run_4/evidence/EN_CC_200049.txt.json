      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the severity of a climate change impact (heat-related deaths) by presenting alternative data to minimize the perceived problem, fitting the definition of minimizing the significance or impact of climate change."

      "reasoning": "The text uses selective data to cast doubt on the scientific claim (from Science Alert) that heat is the leading weather-related killer, thereby raising doubts about the data and consensus on climate change impacts."

      "evidence_quote": "According to the Lancet, people around the world are 9.4 times more likely to die from the cold than from the heat. It added that over the past 20 years, the death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that the negative impact of increased temperatures (heat-related deaths) is minimal and is outweighed by a decrease in cold-related deaths, suggesting the overall impact of climate change is not significant or is even beneficial in this specific context."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly counters a specific claim made by climate change proponents (that heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths) by presenting alternative data. It supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change by challenging the severity of its claimed consequences, but the argument's focus on mortality statistics does not cleanly fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about natural cycles, human causation, or sea levels)."

      "reasoning": "This quote uses data to argue that the net effect of temperature changes (implied by 'global warming') is a significant decrease in cold-related mortality, which indirectly questions the severity and negative impact of the temperature increase, a core claim of climate science."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a specific claim made by the climate movement (Science Alert) by presenting counter-data, arguing their factual basis is wrong. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.' It is a distinct form of criticism based on disputing facts."

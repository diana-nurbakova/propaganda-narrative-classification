    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "After multiple instances of vandalism against famous landmarks and artistic works of western cultural significance, many people are growing annoyed with the actions of climate alarmists.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the actions and methods of climate activists, framing them as 'alarmists' whose vandalism is causing public annoyance, which aligns with the narrative of challenging the motives, integrity, or impact of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical statement '(it's not)' explicitly denies that man-made climate change is a legitimate threat, which directly minimizes the significance and validity of climate change."
    }
  ],
  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate protests will likely increase in the next two months, with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that climate activists exploit normal seasonal weather to make exaggerated and unfulfilled predictions about global warming, framing their actions as alarmist and disconnected from reality."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda, blind belief in climate hysteria is on the decline.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'climate propaganda' and the implication of massive, wasteful spending by governments and NGOs to promote 'hysteria' frames the climate movement as being driven by corrupt financial motives and deceptive practices rather than genuine concern."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Those 'Extinction Rebellion' activists everyone loves to hate are at it again.",
      "reasoning": "This opening statement frames the activists as universally disliked ('everyone loves to hate'), launching a direct, reputation-based attack on the group and its members rather than engaging with their arguments."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What they don't seem to understand is that not all attention is good attention... For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement's tactics as counterproductive and damaging to their own cause, arguing their actions generate negative public sentiment. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Human activities do not impact climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "This direct statement explicitly denies that human-caused (man-made) climate change is a real threat, which matches the definition of the subnarrative that climate change is not caused by human activity."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A perfect encapsulation of the phony cause of 'climate change' protest.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'phony cause' directly dismisses and downplays the entire premise of climate change activism, supporting the parent narrative of downplaying climate change. This argument does not fit any of the more specific scientific or impact-based subnarratives provided."

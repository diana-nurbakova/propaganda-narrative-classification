      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly questions the effectiveness and predicts catastrophic human consequences of the climate policy advocated by the Just Stop Oil movement, framing it as genocidal."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda. ... member of groups like Just Stop Oil have been deluded – or perhaps deluded themselves – into believing that they must appease the climate gods",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly labels the climate movement's motivation as stemming from 'propaganda' and 'delusion,' challenging the integrity and rationality of its members and their beliefs."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This statement minimizes the significance of human-caused emissions by claiming natural sources are far greater, thereby downplaying the human impact on climate change."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "The text cites an authority figure to cast doubt on the scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, directly questioning the supporting science for a key climate policy."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "The text vividly amplifies fears by describing an apocalyptic scenario of mass death and societal collapse resulting from implementing the climate movement's demands, going beyond factual policy critique to instill terror."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that implementing the climate policy (stopping oil use) would fail to achieve its intended environmental goal and instead lead to catastrophic human death, framing the policy as fundamentally ineffective and counterproductive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "On the very first day of an oil- and gas-free world... all homes, businesses, and other structures that rely on either or both of these for light, heat, fuel, or what have you would no longer function.",
      "reasoning": "This quote describes a scenario where the cessation of fossil fuel use would cause immediate and total dysfunction of homes and businesses, directly linking the policy to severe negative economic and societal collapse."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda.",
      "reasoning": "This statement, in the context of the article which frames climate concerns as a delusion, suggests that the push for climate policies (like stopping oil) is driven by manipulative communication (propaganda) rather than genuine environmental concern, implying ulterior motives which can include financial or power-driven gain."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The theory that climate fanatics have adopted... blames human activity and industry, even though the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases'... than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by attacking the foundational scientific premise of climate policies, arguing they are based on a false cause (human activity) when natural sources are claimed to be larger. This is a criticism of the policy's rationale but does not fit the definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'fear of \"boiling oceans\"' uses exaggerated, alarmist language to characterize the climate movement's concerns, suggesting they are hyperbolic and not based in reality."

      "evidence_quote": "If we 'just stop oil' like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die... Six billion deaths are about as genocidal as it gets...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes the climate movement by presenting an extreme, catastrophic consequence (mass death/genocide) of its proposed policy, which is a distinct form of criticism not covered by the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that natural sources (volcanoes) emit more greenhouse gases than human activities (cars, cattle), thereby arguing that human activity is not the primary driver of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by citing an authority figure to claim there is no scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, which is a form of downplaying the urgency and scientific consensus on climate action. It does not fit any of the other specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the scientific consensus by asserting that natural sources of greenhouse gases dwarf human contributions, thereby arguing that human-caused CO2 is not the primary driver of climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Scientific community is unreliable",
      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses the authority of a COP28 president to claim a lack of scientific backing for a major climate policy, thereby discrediting the scientific consensus that supports fossil fuel phase-out."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Do you believe the planet is melting or boiling due to man-made climate change? Learn more about why this is not the case at Climate.news.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly dismisses the core claims of man-made climate change ('melting or boiling') and directs readers to a source that argues 'this is not the case,' which supports the parent narrative of questioning climate science but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'boiling oceans destroying the planet' is a hyperbolic and alarmist description of ocean warming, amplifying existing fears by using extreme, panic-inducing imagery."

      "evidence_quote": "As the end of the biblical age of grace approaches, the world is increasingly coming unhinged, including environmentally as the birth pangs intensify.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames environmental changes as part of a biblical apocalypse narrative. It supports the parent narrative of amplifying climate fears by linking them to religious end-times prophecy, which is not covered by the other specific subnarrative definitions."

      "reasoning": "This statement challenges the competence and priorities of Mayor Garcetti and his administration, suggesting he is neglecting pressing domestic issues in favor of international climate talks, thereby undermining his authority and effectiveness."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific climate policy (the Green New Deal) by highlighting its political opposition and electoral failure, suggesting it is not achieving its intended goals, which aligns with the definition of policies being ineffective."

      "evidence_quote": "The C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action – it’s a chance to elevate the solutions cities are deploying at a neighborhood level that have a real impact on people’s daily lives.",
      "reasoning": "The article frames the summit and Garcetti's participation as hypocritical and performative, implying the action is for show or political gain rather than genuine environmental concern, especially when contrasted with the carbon cost of his travel. The overall tone suggests the policies and summits are driven by motives other than pure environmentalism."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes climate policies and actors by highlighting hypocrisy and poor prioritization (choosing a carbon-intensive trip over local issues), which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

      "reasoning": "This statement expresses disapproval of the decision-making and actions of the authorities (the summit organizers and/or Garcetti) by questioning the necessity of the in-person event, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit the specific definitions targeting the EU, international entities, national governments, or political organizations/figures."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly threatens catastrophic retaliation against Western Europe (specifically being 'leveled to the ground') if Western support for Ukraine continues, framing the West's actions as leading to its own destruction."

      "reasoning": "This statement argues that Western support for Ukraine is a waste of European resources ('taxpayers’ euros') and is counterproductive, harming both European interests and Ukraine itself.

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a catastrophic escalation, suggesting that continued Western support for Ukraine will provoke a unified Slavic (implied Russian-led) retaliation that would destroy Western Europe, which is a clear warning against upsetting Russia and evokes the fear of a broader, continent-wide war."

      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by framing the conflict as a destructive, futile, and externally driven 'proxy war' that harms European interests and Ukraine itself. It supports the parent narrative of amplifying fears about the war's continuation but does not fit the specific definitions of nuclear use, NATO intervention, or an attack on other countries. It is a distinct argument about the war's nature and consequences."

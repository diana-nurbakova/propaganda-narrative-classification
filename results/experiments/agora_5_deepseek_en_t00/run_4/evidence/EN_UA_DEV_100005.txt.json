    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly questions the reliability and framing of Western media coverage, accusing it of prolonging the conflict, which fits the narrative of undermining confidence in media sources."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly evokes fear and anxiety about the potential for nuclear war, presenting it as an imminent or desired outcome, which aligns with amplifying war-related fears."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "we deserve EVERYTHING we get",
      "reasoning": "This statement, in the context of the preceding text blaming Western governments and bureaucrats, implies that Western populations will face severe negative consequences (like nuclear war) as a result of their leaders' actions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "amerika always blew any comment about RUSSIA or at later stages CHINA way out of proportion.. and you are still doing",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses the West (specifically America) of consistently and disproportionately exaggerating threats from Russia and China, which aligns with the definition of portraying the West's reactions as disproportionate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death. The question is, why the desperation to keep the war going?",
      "reasoning": "This implies that the West, through its media, is deliberately prolonging the war for its own reasons (e.g., to weaken Russia) rather than seeking a peaceful resolution for Ukraine's benefit, suggesting the West's interests are paramount."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "yes but where is what he says getting us …seems nowhere",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses futility about the impact of truthful discourse (like Ritter's), implicitly suggesting that diplomatic or informative efforts are ineffective and leading nowhere."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "amerikans are the greatest pigs on the planet…and that is in the most derogitive term you can imagine.. absolute pigs",
      "reasoning": "This is a broad, vitriolic attack on the character and value of Americans (representing the West) that supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West but does not fit neatly into any of the more specific diplomatic subnarrative definitions provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "Another must listen to interview with information that you are missing from the corporation propaganda western media",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly labels Western media as 'corporation propaganda,' framing it as a tool that withholds or distorts information, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Western media institutions as instruments of propaganda."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by accusing Western media of a specific harmful framing ('as if Russia is losing') that has negative consequences. It discredits Western media's reporting but does not fit the more specific definitions of being an 'instrument of propaganda' or targeting Ukrainian media; it is a distinct argument about misleading framing."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear and anxiety about the use of nuclear weapons, framing a full nuclear war as a plausible and imminent outcome, which aligns with the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Will they resort to nuclear weapons to even out the war?",
      "reasoning": "This question from the text's description amplifies war-related fear by speculating about the potential use of nuclear weapons as a desperate measure, supporting the parent narrative. However, it is presented as a speculative question rather than a definitive statement of possibility, making it distinct from the more direct evidence used for the specific 'nuclear weapons will be employed' subnarrative."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "for the west it’s always been the soviet (RUSSIAN) that has ALWAYS been the boogie man..when in fact they were SELDOM a threat.. amerika always blew any comment about RUSSIA or at later stages CHINA way out of proportion.. and you are still doing …",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Western (specifically American) actions and rhetoric towards Russia as exaggerated and provocative, implying that the West's confrontational stance is based on a false premise and is therefore self-destructive, aligning with the idea that Western policies will backfire."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly and no more of month after month of promises from Trump or threats from the east….POOF..it’s all over …thanks mostly to un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries” they are proving the worst of the worst of humanity",
      "reasoning": "This quote catastrophizes the potential outcome of the conflict for the West, suggesting a nuclear war leading to annihilation, which is a negative consequence. It does not fit the 'sanctions backfire' or 'refugee flows' subnarratives but clearly supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West."

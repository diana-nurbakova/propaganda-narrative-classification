      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of living (housing, fuel, utilities) to green policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American... who warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Biden's policies as a 'globalist green agenda' with harmful consequences, challenging the competence and intentions of the administration and its institutions."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment...",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies (wind, solar, biomass), labeling them as inefficient, expensive, and environmentally destructive."

      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions whether green policies weaken national strength and resilience in the context of geopolitical conflict, framing them as instruments that could compromise geopolitical power."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring. \"And these elevated prices for essentials factor into price increases for everything else.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of housing, fuel, and utilities to climate policies, arguing they negatively impact the economy by making essential goods and services unaffordable."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "\"These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that the promoted renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are environmentally destructive and incapable of meeting energy demands, thereby criticizing the effectiveness of the policies promoting them."

      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies on grounds of national security and military preparedness, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific subnarratives for economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "This opening statement directly criticizes the policies of a specific political figure, President Biden, linking them to negative economic consequences for citizens."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes... Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes.",
      "reasoning": "This criticizes the actions and policies of the U.S. national government (the Biden administration and its Department of Energy), framing its green building code initiatives as coercive and financially burdensome."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of \"green\" policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills... How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?",
      "reasoning": "This quote broadly criticizes the outcomes of government 'green policies' on affordability and national strength. While it implicates political figures, its core argument is a sweeping criticism of the policy framework and its consequences, which extends beyond the specific definitions of criticizing figures, governments, or international entities."

      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are inefficient and expensive, matching the definition of the 'costly' subnarrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is unreliable",
      "evidence_quote": "These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "The claim that renewable sources 'cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy' needed for prosperity directly supports the assertion that they are not dependable for widespread adoption, fitting the 'unreliable' subnarrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "BLINDED by MONEY: Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that wind farms are killing wildlife (eagles and whales), which frames renewable energy as posing significant risks and dangers to the environment."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,' wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative (controversy about green technologies) by blaming green policies for broad affordability crises (housing, rent, gasoline, utilities), but this specific argument about socio-economic impact does not fit any of the more specific technical subnarratives (dangerous, unreliable, costly, nuclear). Therefore, it is a remainder requiring the 'Other' classification."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the domestic economic consequences of green policies (unaffordable housing, energy) as a national security weakness, implying that these policies are a form of geopolitical self-sabotage that leaves the country vulnerable to adversaries, which aligns with the idea of international climate relations being exploitative or abusive to national strength."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Edward Ring... warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' directly frames the policies as instruments of a supranational or international agenda, which supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments. This specific phrasing does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives but clearly advances the core idea that climate policy is a tool for broader geopolitical control or influence."

      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions Russia's invasion as a cause, but also includes 'the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych' as a contributing factor to Ukraine's financial crisis. This fits the narrative of shifting some blame for negative outcomes (Ukraine's economic distress) away from the sole aggressor (Russia) and onto a Ukrainian actor."

      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the 'civilized world' (the West) as taking aggressive financial actions (sanctions, asset confiscation) against an 'aggressor', implying the West is an active party in the conflict and its financial measures are a form of aggression, which aligns with shifting responsibility for the conflict's dynamics to the Western block."

      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This statement attributes part of the cause for Ukraine's 2015 financial crisis not only to Russia's invasion but also to the 'poor policies' of a former Ukrainian president. This shifts some blame for the consequences of the war onto Ukrainian leadership, supporting the parent narrative of blaming the war on others, but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policy (in this case, guidelines on washing frequency) as an unjust infringement on fundamental personal rights, questioning its motives and impact on daily life."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the WEF, accusing it of hypocrisy and of targeting ordinary citizens while protecting elite interests."

      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "The text portrays the WEF as a powerful, unelected globalist group (\"the unelected globalist founder\") scheming to use environmental policy to oppress ordinary citizens for the benefit of elites, fitting the narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing “the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.”",
      "reasoning": "The text connects the WEF's environmental agenda (promoting reduced washing) with its praise for China's policies and its globalist collaboration, implying environmental policies are tools for geopolitical alignment and influence rather than purely environmental goals."

      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly contrasts the proposed policy (restricting laundry) with the massive carbon footprint of the elites promoting it, arguing that the policy focus is misdirected and therefore ineffective at addressing the real sources of emissions."

      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames climate policy as a tool used by elites to protect their own privileges and financial interests ('perks and privileges for billionaires') while imposing burdens on ordinary citizens, aligning with the definition that policies are driven by gain rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by portraying them as an extreme, rights-stripping overreach that infringes on personal hygiene and dignity, a theme not covered by the more specific economic or profit-driven subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The text directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and 'ordering' governments, portraying it as an overreaching authority imposing unreasonable climate-related policies on the public."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes 'neoliberal politicians' and 'globalist billionaires' associated with the WEF, accusing them of hypocrisy by contributing heavily to carbon emissions while advocating for restrictive policies on ordinary citizens."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities (the WEF) by accusing it of protecting elite privileges while targeting citizens' rights, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of criticizing the EU, national governments, or international entities in a purely policy-focused way. It adds a distinct layer of criticism about elitism and rights-stripping."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly blames a specific group of 'globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians' (the elites) for hypocrisy and excessive environmental impact, contrasting their actions with the restrictive policies they advocate for the public."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims the WEF's climate agenda (focusing environmental policy on public restrictions) is driven by the ulterior motive of protecting elite privileges and stripping rights from ordinary citizens, rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of secretive powerful groups (the WEF) orchestrating hidden plots (issuing orders and guidelines to governments to restrict public behavior), but the specific argument about controlling personal hygiene and consumption does not neatly fit the definitions of 'Blaming global elites' or 'Climate agenda has hidden motives' as standalone themes."

      "reasoning": "This quote, combined with the context of the WEF's 'Summer Davos' being held in China and the article's framing, suggests green/climate policies are instruments for geopolitical alignment and favoritism, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting the more specific 'neo-colonialism' or 'abusive relations' definitions."

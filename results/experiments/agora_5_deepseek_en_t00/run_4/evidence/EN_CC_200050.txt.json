      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act... the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, implying that climate policies requiring a quick shift are impractical and could harm energy security and developing nations."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames climate-related financial actions (shareholder resolutions and divestment threats) as tools of political and financial pressure, suggesting environmental policies are being used to exert control and influence over corporate behavior rather than being purely about environmental concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF. The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the banks' climate actions as financial investments and portfolio rebalancing, suggesting the primary driver is profit-seeking in a growing 'green' market rather than a genuine environmental concern, aligning with the subnarrative that climate policies are driven by financial gain."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline uses the phrase 'Bend The Knee,' which frames climate policies as a form of coercive submission to activist pressure rather than a rational or voluntary policy choice. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "\"On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote, from Citigroup's CEO, frames the global push for a green transition as potentially exploitative, highlighting how developing nations lack the means to comply, which could place them at an economic disadvantage dictated by international climate frameworks and alliances like the Net Zero Banking Alliance."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "\"many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that the green transition agenda, driven by international alliances and major Western banks, imposes requirements on developing nations that they cannot meet due to a lack of resources and infrastructure. This mirrors neo-colonial dynamics where developed nations set the rules, exerting control and creating dependency, rather than enabling equitable development."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios... New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.\"",
      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by depicting climate activism and financial pressure (e.g., shareholder resolutions, threats to pull pension funds) as tools to coercively reshape global investment and energy policies, extending the narrative beyond international relations and neo-colonialism to include domestic financial coercion as an instrument of geopolitical climate policy."

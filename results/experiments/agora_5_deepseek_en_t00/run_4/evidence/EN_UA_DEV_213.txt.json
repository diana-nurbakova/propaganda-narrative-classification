      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",

      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the conflict and its escalation to the United States and its European allies, portraying them as the deliberate instigators seeking war, which aligns with the definition of blaming the West as the aggressors."

      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This statement suggests that allegations of Russian aggression are a cover for a false-flag operation by Ukrainian forces trained by the US, thereby blaming the West (via Ukraine) for provocative actions that could lead to war."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago... Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.",
      "reasoning": "This frames the current crisis as a consequence of NATO expansion and military posturing, portraying NATO's actions as the primary threat and source of conflict, thus blaming the West for creating the conditions for war."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the war on others (US media and domestic crisis motives) but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions, as it introduces a distinct motive of domestic distraction."

      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented...",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly accuses Western governments and media of generating alarmist claims about a Russian invasion without evidence, framing their reaction as disproportionate and based on lies."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames Western actions as not being about Ukraine's welfare, but rather using the country as a 'pretext' for their own geopolitical confrontation with Russia, disregarding Ukraine's fate."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted. It writes: 'With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.'",
      "reasoning": "The text cites and seemingly endorses the Post's statement that the diplomatic window is closing or was never open, supporting the subnarrative that diplomatic efforts are futile or not genuinely pursued."

      "reasoning": "This claim supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West by attributing its actions to a cynical, manipulative domestic motive (distraction from crisis), which does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses specific Western media outlets (NYT, WaPo) of leading a disinformation campaign, presenting lies as fact to manipulate public opinion, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Western media as instruments of propaganda."

      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly discredits media across the Atlantic as 'filthy pro-imperialist,' supporting the parent narrative of distrust towards media. It does not specifically target only Western or Ukrainian media, and thus serves as distinct evidence not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that NATO should take a more aggressive military action (delivering lethal weapons) in the conflict, which aligns with the subnarrative definition of suggesting NATO ought to or will take direct military action."

      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by accusing the US and NATO of deliberately seeking war, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about WW3, attacking other countries, nuclear weapons, or direct NATO intervention as defined."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence",
      "evidence_quote": "Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames any potential Russian military action as a defensive and understandable reaction to NATO's eastward expansion and its intention to incorporate Ukraine, thereby justifying Russia's posture as self-defence against external threat."

The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented... As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Western governments and media as maliciously fabricating evidence and promoting lies about Russian aggression, suggesting the negative reaction is driven by a biased, anti-Russian perspective rather than facts."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests Ukraine, with US backing, is planning a 'false-flag' operation, portraying Ukrainian forces as extremist proxies actively working against Russia, which aligns with the narrative of Ukraine being comprised of anti-Russian elements."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as a victim of Western/NATO demands that infringe on its sovereignty and treat it like a defeated nation, a theme not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."

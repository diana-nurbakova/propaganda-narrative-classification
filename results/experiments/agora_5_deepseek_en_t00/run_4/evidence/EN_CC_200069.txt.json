      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the destruction of 'street zone sectioning barriers' as a positive act of resistance, directly challenging the implementation of a specific climate or urban policy (likely related to traffic or emissions reduction)."
    },

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' directly challenges the motives and rationality of the climate movement, portraying its goals and actions as irrational or extreme."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate change as 'The Climate Con' (a con or fraud) fundamentally downplays its significance and legitimacy, suggesting it is a deceptive scheme rather than a genuine issue."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate policies as irrational and misguided, implying they are not a sensible or effective response to climate issues."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast. Or you can make a donation here.",
      "reasoning": "The text labels climate action as 'The Climate Con' (a con implying a scam or fraud) and directly solicits financial support to fight it, suggesting the narrative that climate policies are a deceptive scheme for financial gain."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "This describes direct, illegal action against a specific climate policy (traffic filters/street zoning), which criticizes the policy's implementation and social acceptance but does not directly address its ineffectiveness, economic impact, or profit motive as defined in the other subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'madness' frames the climate change movement and its associated policies as irrational and hysterical, which aligns with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist and exaggerating the issue."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate action as 'The Climate Con' (short for 'con game' or 'confidence trick') directly alleges that the climate movement is a fraudulent scheme, implying it is driven by deception and ulterior motives, which matches the definition of the movement being corrupt."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s very inspiring to see the people of the UK take matters into their own hands. This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by celebrating and encouraging active resistance and civil disobedience against climate policies, a form of criticism that is not captured by the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate change action as irrational or extreme, which is a form of downplaying its seriousness and legitimacy, but does not fit any of the more specific scientific or impact-denial subnarratives provided."

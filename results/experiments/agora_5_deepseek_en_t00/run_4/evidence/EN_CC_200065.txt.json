      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly raises doubt about the scientific basis for claims of long-term temperature records by highlighting the short duration of instrumental data collection, which aligns with the narrative's definition of casting doubt on scientific methods and data."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the validity and comparability of paleoclimate proxy data used to support claims about historical temperatures, directly challenging the scientific methodology behind the 'hottest day in thousands of years' assertion."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely “the hottest day in thousands of years.”",
      "reasoning": "The use of the pejorative term 'alarmists' to label those making climate claims challenges the credibility and motives of the climate movement, framing their communication as exaggerated or fear-driven."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert that 2024 is “the planet’s hottest year yet since at least the pre-industrial era, and likely for at least 100,000 years before that” (emphasis added).",
      "reasoning": "Describing the claims as 'extravagant' and using skeptical language ('likely for at least 100,000 years') criticizes the climate movement for making what the text implies are unsupported or exaggerated assertions."

      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question at the end of the article sarcastically dismisses the scientific claims presented earlier, minimizing their significance and framing them as a narrative ('a good story') rather than factual science, which downplays the issue of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by questioning the validity of long-term temperature claims based on the limited duration of direct data collection. It does not fit the specific definitions of questioning data reliability, denying temperature increase, denying the greenhouse effect, or attacking the scientific community's reliability, but it clearly questions the scientific basis of the measurements."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by casting doubt on the claims of historical temperature extremes, arguing they are based on an insufficiently long instrumental record. It questions the science but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about faulty methodologies, no temperature increase, greenhouse effect, or direct attacks on the scientific community's reliability."

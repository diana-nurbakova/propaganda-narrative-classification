    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism... For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Greta Thunberg and her associated thinkers as having a hidden, radical political agenda (anti-capitalism, de-growth) that supersedes genuine environmental concern, directly challenging the motives and integrity of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "The concluding statement explicitly claims that the climate movement's true goal is not environmental protection but the geopolitical and ideological destruction of Western civilization, positioning green policies as a tool for this purpose."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion... admitted in his own words that his movement 'isn’t about the climate.'... Basden revealed the true goals of the far-left environmentalist action group... focused on tearing down the entire system of western capitalism",
      "reasoning": "The text presents a narrative where the public-facing goal of the climate movement (addressing climate change) is a cover for a hidden, radical plot by a defined group (far-left activists) to overthrow the capitalist system and Western civilization."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly frames Greta Thunberg's role as one of excessive, dramatic warning, using the metaphor of an 'alarm bell' and 'Cassandra' to suggest her messaging is alarmist in nature."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'demented manifesto' is a direct personal attack on Greta Thunberg, questioning her sanity and the validity of her stated goals, which fits the definition of an ad hominem attack on a key activist."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "Labeling a major climate conference (COP) as a 'scam' that facilitates dishonesty and 'greenwashing' implies the broader climate movement and its institutional efforts are corrupt and engage in unethical practices."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by alleging its true, hidden purpose is not environmental but a radical political ideology ('radical leftism'). This supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks on a specific individual."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Normal” was the “system” which gave us the climate crisis, a system of “colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide”, of “racist, oppressive extractionism”.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly frames the climate crisis and the system behind it as rooted in colonialism and imperialism, suggesting that green activism is a response to and a critique of these historical and ongoing exploitative practices, aligning with the idea of green initiatives as a form of anti-colonial or neo-colonial critique."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This concluding statement explicitly frames the climate movement not as a genuine environmental effort but as a geopolitical instrument aimed at destroying Western civilization and its values, which supports the parent narrative that green policies are tools for broader geopolitical ends, but does not fit neatly into the 'neo-colonialism' or 'abusive relations' subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly claims that the stated goal of climate action is a facade for a different, radical political motive, aligning with the definition of the climate agenda having hidden motives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "We can’t trust the elites produced by this system to confront its flaws – that’s why she, much like Rishi Sunak, won’t be bothering with the COP meeting this year. COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying international climate institutions (COP) as a deceptive scheme run by untrustworthy elites, which is a hidden plot theme but does not fit neatly into the 'Blaming global elites' or 'Climate agenda has hidden motives' definitions as precisely as the other evidence."

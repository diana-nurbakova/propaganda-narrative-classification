      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto Western powers (the UK and US), framing them as the ones who prevented a peaceful settlement."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained... the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers that no amount of foreign aid or equipment transfers can do anything to alleviate... the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "These statements collectively undermine Ukraine's military effectiveness and strategic position, portraying its efforts as futile and its government as struggling with severe, unsolvable manpower issues."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement blames the prolongation of the war on Ukraine and its Western backers for their 'provocations,' which supports the parent narrative of blaming others for the war but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as cleanly, as it combines both and focuses on escalation rather than initial aggression."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by stating their major offensive failed and resulted in net territorial losses."

      "reasoning": "This statement delegitimizes the Ukrainian government's decision-making, portraying it as incompetent and easily manipulated by foreign powers, leading to a worse outcome for the country."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv... But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This portrays Ukraine's military situation as having no viable positive future, emphasizing an inevitable failure to achieve its goals and an inability to sustain its defense."

      "reasoning": "This claim presents Ukraine's critical wartime decisions as being controlled by Western powers (the US and UK), undermining its sovereignty and portraying it as a puppet."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly contrasts Russia's robust military production with the West's comparatively weaker output, presenting the West as non-potent and unable to match Russia's war effort, which aligns with the definition of 'The West is weak'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims Western powers (UK and US) persuaded Ukraine to reject a peace deal and continue fighting, implying the West prioritizes its own strategic interests (prolonging the conflict) over Ukraine's welfare and the chance for peace."

      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western leadership (Biden, NATO) as delusional and irresponsible, advocating for a shift to diplomacy. It criticizes Western strategy but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about division, weakness, overreaction, lack of care, diplomatic failure, or fatigue)."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII",
      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But the West’s chosen depiction of Putin as a tyrant bent on conquering the entire European continent suffered its latest setback last month when it came out that the Russian president is interested in halting the fighting and negotiating a deal that recognizes the current battlefield lines.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by challenging the portrayal of Russia as an expansionist threat, suggesting the war is unnecessary and its prolongation is driven by Western refusal to negotiate. It amplifies fears about the consequences of continuing the war but does not fit the specific definitions of the other subnarratives."

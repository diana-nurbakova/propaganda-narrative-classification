      "reasoning": "The quote is a direct prediction about the potential future capture of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, by Russian forces, which fits the definition of speculating about war outcomes."

      "evidence_quote": "Putin said Tuesday that Russian troops would push further into Ukraine to build on their success on the battlefield after the weekend fall of the town of Avdiivka where he said Ukrainian troops had been forced to flee in chaos.",
      "reasoning": "The statement portrays Ukrainian troops as disorganized and defeated ('forced to flee in chaos'), undermining their military effectiveness and legitimacy."

      "reasoning": "This quote glorifies Russia's territorial claims and cultural influence, portraying the annexation of Odesa as a rightful and positive act of bringing a city 'home' to Russia."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests a decline in Ukrainian military effectiveness and strength by stating they are at a severe material disadvantage and facing a critical shortage of external support, which supports the subnarrative of the Ukrainian army collapsing."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on a future war outcome (the capture of Kyiv) but does not fit the specific definitions of 'Russian army is collapsing', 'Russian army will lose all occupied territories', or 'Ukrainian army is collapsing'. It is a speculative prediction of a Russian military advance, which is a core theme of the parent narrative 'Speculating war outcomes'."

      "evidence_quote": "On the eve of its second anniversary, Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's, and a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Ukraine as being in a dire military situation with no immediate prospect for improvement due to being outmatched and lacking critical Western support, aligning with the definition of portraying Ukraine as having no viable positive future."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly claims the Ukrainian city of Odesa as historically and culturally Russian, which is a clear attempt to rewrite Ukraine's history and territorial integrity to justify Russian claims."

      "evidence_quote": "Putin said Tuesday that Russian troops would push further into Ukraine to build on their success on the battlefield after the weekend fall of the town of Avdiivka where he said Ukrainian troops had been forced to flee in chaos.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, which frames the Ukrainian retreat from Avdiivka as a chaotic flight, serves to discredit Ukraine's military performance and morale. While it touches on military discrediting, its primary function in this context is to support the broader narrative of Ukrainian weakness and Russian success, which is a core element of the parent narrative 'Discrediting Ukraine' but is not fully captured by the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not just about capabilities/professionalism but about portraying a general state of defeat and disorder)."

      "evidence_quote": "Russian troops will go much further into Ukraine, taking the southern city of Odesa and might even one day push on to the capital Kyiv",
      "reasoning": "This statement projects confidence in the future offensive capabilities and expansion of the Russian military, positively highlighting its potential scale and reach."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames Putin as a decisive leader announcing and building on military successes, presenting his strategic vision positively."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,\" Medvedev said.",
      "reasoning": "This statement portrays Russia's territorial ambitions as a benevolent 'homecoming' for a city, framing Russian control as a natural and positive outcome for its people, aligning with the idea of Russia providing prosperity and unity."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Russian invasion has strong national support",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict.",
      "reasoning": "This statement, while from the article's author, interprets Medvedev's hawkish stance as reflective of a broader confidence within the Russian leadership and, by implication, national support for the war's progression."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia says the territory its forces control is part of Russia and that it will never be given up.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by presenting Russia's position as resolute and justified, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about military might, Putin, peace/prosperity, or support). It is a distinct argument legitimizing Russia's territorial claims."

      "evidence_quote": "According to a report from the Committee to Unleash Prosperity (CUP), America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote challenges the integrity and intentions of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and wealthy elites by suggesting their support for rationing is based on an alleged, rather than genuine, climate motive."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes climate policies by framing them as an attack on personal liberty and quality of life, driven by an out-of-touch elite. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

      "evidence_quote": "In fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the beliefs and judgment of the 'elite' class, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities. However, it does not specifically target the EU, international entities, national governments, or political organizations/figures as defined in the other subnarratives; it is a broader criticism of an elite social class and their perceived disconnect from the public."

      "reasoning": "The use of \"allegedly\" and the framing of rationing as a plan imposed on the public suggests the stated motive of fighting climate change is a pretext for a more sinister agenda of control and restriction, aligning with the subnarrative of hidden motives."

      "reasoning": "The quote frames the WEF's climate agenda as a plan for the wealthy elite to impose restrictive policies on the general public, characterizing the international climate policy framework as a tool for exploitation and control by a powerful group over the populace."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by presenting green policies (the Net Zero agenda) as instruments of coercion and forced compliance, which is a distinct argument about their instrumental use for control that is not fully captured by the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives."

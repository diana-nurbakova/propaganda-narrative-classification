      "evidence_quote": "Climate cultists push bizarre scare language about weather: “rain bombs” and “boiling oceans”",
      "reasoning": "The opening phrase 'Climate cultists' is a derogatory term that challenges the motives and integrity of the climate movement, framing its language as 'bizarre' and fear-mongering."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "\"That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers, and the rain bombs, and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level, and causing these waves of climate refugees, predicted to reach one billion in this century.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote, attributed to Al Gore, is presented as an example of the 'scare language' the article criticizes. It lists catastrophic consequences (boiling oceans, droughts, melting ice, a billion refugees) to emphasize and amplify fears about climate change, which the article then frames as alarmist."

      "evidence_quote": "The legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for \"renewable energy,\" meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes a specific climate policy (the Inflation Reduction Act), questioning its economic allocation and predicting a negative outcome ('a very dark and cold future'), thereby challenging the effectiveness and impact of the policy."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Renewable energy ... is now the cheapest source of electricity in almost the entire planet,\" Gore lied.",
      "reasoning": "The article explicitly labels Gore's statement about renewable energy cost as a lie, expressing clear skepticism and criticism of the claims made about environmentally friendly technologies."

      "evidence_quote": "\"I have been hearing about these end of the world scenarios since I was a kid. And not one of their predictions has come true. Global cooling, global warming, mass extinction, mass famine, the polar ice caps melting, mass flooding, the ozone layer depleted, etc.\"",
      "reasoning": "This comment, presented approvingly, minimizes the significance of climate change by claiming past predictions have consistently failed, thereby suggesting the current concerns are exaggerated and not credible."

      "reasoning": "The opening phrase labels climate activists as a 'cult' and characterizes their terminology as 'bizarre scare language,' directly accusing them of using exaggerated, frightening rhetoric to describe weather events."

      "reasoning": "This quote attacks the personal credibility and integrity of Al Gore, a key climate activist, by highlighting his alleged personal fossil fuel consumption to undermine his message, which is a classic ad hominem attack."

      "reasoning": "This quote from a commenter criticizes the climate movement by claiming its predictions have consistently failed, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem' subnarratives. It is a distinct argument about the movement's track record."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly presents a catastrophic scenario of mass extinction and a planetary crisis, framing climate change as an existential threat to humanity's future, which aligns with the definition of presenting intense catastrophic scenarios."

      "reasoning": "This statement uses a dramatic and fear-inducing analogy (Hiroshima atomic bombs) to amplify existing fears about the heat-trapping effects of greenhouse gases and global warming, speculating on severe side effects."

      "reasoning": "This phrase from the article's framing criticizes the language used by climate advocates as 'bizarre scare language,' which supports the parent narrative of amplifying climate fears by highlighting the use of alarming terminology, but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote attacks the personal hypocrisy of a key climate policy advocate, implying his advocacy is not genuine and is compatible with personal profiteering and luxury, casting doubt on the motives behind the policies he promotes."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Rain bombs? Bomb cyclones? Atmospheric rivers? They really are losing their minds,' wrote a commenter about how all sorts of common weather events now have scary new names aimed at frightening the general public into giving up cheap and abundant energy in exchange for globalist 'green' energy.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the communication tactics (using 'scary new names') of climate advocates, arguing they are manipulative and designed to frighten the public into accepting policies. This specific argument about manipulative language does not fit the other defined subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames the massive investment in renewable energy as leading to a negative outcome ('a very dark and cold future'), directly implying that renewable energy is an expensive and undesirable path that will reduce quality of life."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Renewable energy ... is now the cheapest source of electricity in almost the entire planet,\" Gore lied.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the claim that renewable energy is cost-effective by labeling it a lie, which supports the overarching narrative of controversy about green technologies but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy. It is a general rebuttal of a pro-renewables claim."

Global cooling, global warming, mass extinction, mass famine, the polar ice caps melting, mass flooding, the ozone layer depleted, etc.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change by arguing that climate predictions are consistently wrong and alarmist, but it does not fit any of the specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it does not claim climate cycles are natural, that weather suggests cooling, that impacts are insignificant, etc.). It is a general dismissal of climate concerns based on alleged failed predictions."

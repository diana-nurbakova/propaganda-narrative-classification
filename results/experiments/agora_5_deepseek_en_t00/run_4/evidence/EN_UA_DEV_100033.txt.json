      "evidence_quote": "Appearing on a state TV show Sunday Evening With Vladimir Soloviev, political scientist and Professor of Communications Dmitry Evstafiev argued: “Right now, President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin’s third proposal to the Ukrainian leadership is on the table. This, of course, is a demonstration of his greatest respect and—I would even say—of love by our President towards the Ukrainian people.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Putin's actions as stemming from 'greatest respect' and 'love,' which is a positive, glorifying portrayal of Russia's leader and his intentions."

      "evidence_quote": "Matveychev noted: “There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes and undermines the United States by portraying it as gullible and easily controlled, which fits the narrative of discrediting the West."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "He argued: “Here’s what will be on the table after our victory... For example, the lifting of all sanctions... The dissolution of NATO... Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko... Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote lists a series of severe demands and concessions (dissolution of NATO, extradition of leaders) that would constitute major negative consequences and a defeat for Western interests, presented as an inevitable outcome of Russian victory."

Extradition of all war criminals... We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself... The return of all Russian properties... Are you including Alaska and Fort Ross?”",

      "reasoning": "This statement, as presented by the propagandist, explicitly mentions the possibility of Russia 'dropping a nuclear bomb' in Ukraine, which serves to amplify fears about nuclear weapon use."

      "reasoning": "The host's question directly and casually references the option of tactical or strategic nuclear strikes as part of a list of demands, normalizing the threat and amplifying fear of nuclear escalation."

The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.” The host chimed in to ask: “Are you including Alaska and Fort Ross?” Matveychev nodded: “That was my next point. As well as the Antarctic... We discovered it, so it belongs to us...",
      "reasoning": "The discussion of territorial claims against the United States (Alaska) and other global areas (Antarctic) implies expansionist ambitions and a threat to other nations' sovereignty, aligning with the fear that Russia will attack or make claims on other countries."

This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly labels Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites,' a term used to associate them with Stepan Bandera, a figure linked to Ukrainian nationalism and, in Russian propaganda, to Nazism. The text confirms this is used to brand opponents as 'Nazis,' directly supporting the subnarrative of associating Ukraine with nazism."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames negotiations as a benevolent act by Putin towards the Ukrainian people, implicitly contrasting with the portrayal of the Ukrainian leadership as a separate entity not acting in the people's interest, which aligns with the narrative that Ukraine's true leadership is not independent but a puppet, with Putin dealing directly with the 'people' over the heads of Western-influenced officials."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by presenting it as an object to be acted upon (demilitarized) and a mere pawn in a larger geopolitical conflict with NATO. It frames Ukraine's existence and sovereignty as an obstacle to Russian goals, undermining its legitimacy as an independent state, which is a core theme of discrediting Ukraine but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "“There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "While not direct praise of Russia's support, this quote from a Kremlin-linked figure, presented in the context of watching Tucker Carlson, implies a critical weakness in the US and, by contrast, a Russian advantage in international influence and perception, suggesting Russia's position is understood or accepted by some abroad."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“We can take them down without it.” (in response to a question about nuclear strikes)",
      "reasoning": "This statement, along with the broader context of nuclear threats and demands for reparations/dissolution of NATO, supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as overwhelmingly powerful and capable of dictating terms to the West, which is a form of praise for Russia's strategic position and might that doesn't neatly fit the more specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Multiple state TV shows emphasized the reluctance on the part of the United States and NATO to intervene against Russia’s bloody invasion of its neighbor, presenting it as the proof that the Kremlin can go to any lengths to emerge victorious.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the West's (U.S. and NATO) reluctance to intervene militarily as proof of weakness, allowing Russia to act with impunity, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as non-potent."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the American public is indifferent to Ukraine's fate, suggesting Western support is not driven by genuine concern for Ukraine but by other, presumably self-serving, interests."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "On Friday, Skabeeva claimed: “Jennifer Psaki’s statement said that no matter what Putin does in Ukraine—whether he uses biological weapons or drops a nuclear bomb—the United States won’t get involved.”",
      "reasoning": "This distorted claim presents the West (U.S.) as having an extreme, alarmist view of Russian actions (suggesting they might use WMDs), thereby framing the Western perception and rhetoric as disproportionate to Russia's actual intentions or actions."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West by portraying the United States as gullible and easily controlled, which is a manipulative communication pattern but does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "\"We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that too costs money and we should get it back.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames Western sanctions as causing damage to Russia, for which Russia will demand financial reparations from the West, implying the sanctions will ultimately cost the West rather than achieve their intended goal."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"The dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by outlining a catastrophic negative consequence for the West (the dissolution of its primary military alliance) as a demanded outcome of Russia's victory, which goes beyond the specific themes of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

      "evidence_quote": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to negotiate with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is being packaged as a sign of his love and good will, and not the consequence of mounting losses and humiliating defeats faced by the Russian military in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that the Russian military is facing 'mounting losses and humiliating defeats,' which aligns with the definition of suggesting a significant decline in its effectiveness and strength."

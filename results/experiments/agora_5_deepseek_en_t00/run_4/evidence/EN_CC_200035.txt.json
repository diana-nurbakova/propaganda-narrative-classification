      "reasoning": "This quote questions the economic impact and feasibility of the policy by highlighting the unknown financial burden on taxpayers, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing climate policies for their potential negative economic consequences."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses skepticism and criticism of the green technology transition by associating it with foreign, politically contentious entities, suggesting underlying problems or risks with the technology's implementation."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the green energy investments as being entangled with a foreign geopolitical power (China/CCP), implying the policies are tools for or influenced by geopolitical interests rather than purely environmental goals."

      "reasoning": "This quote highlights an unknown financial burden on taxpayers, framing the policy as potentially economically irresponsible and negatively impacting public finances."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote, and the subsequent discussion of specific Chinese-linked corporate investments (Gotion, CATL), frames the policy as being driven by corporate and foreign financial interests, particularly those linked to the CCP, rather than genuine environmental benefit."

      "evidence_quote": "The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the policy by highlighting strong local opposition and political backlash, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive alone."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly highlights the unknown and potentially significant financial burden of the transition to electric vehicles, framing it as a costly and uncertain expense for taxpayers, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable/green technology is expensive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)... The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "This section criticizes the green energy transition by associating it with foreign (Chinese) influence, political controversy, and local opposition. It supports the parent narrative of 'controversy about green technologies' but does not fit the definitions of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy. It introduces a separate line of controversy regarding geopolitical entanglements and public dissent."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links the state's green energy policy (electrifying the fleet) to foreign investment and influence from China, framing the initiative as a vehicle for a foreign power (China/CCP) to exert control and establish economic presence, which aligns with the definition of neo-colonialism in the context of green activities."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Gotion Inc., linked to the CCP, plans to build a $2.4 billion EV battery plant in the Big Rapids, Michigan, area at Whitmer’s behest.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by highlighting a specific instance where a climate-related industrial project (an EV battery plant) is tied to a foreign political entity (the CCP). It suggests the policy is being used to facilitate foreign influence, but the specific argument about it being 'exploitative' or 'neo-colonial' is not fully articulated here; it is a distinct piece of evidence for the broader narrative."

      "reasoning": "This statement shifts blame for the conflict by implying that the U.S. (and the West) is responsible for prolonging the war due to its economic interests, rather than attributing the war to Russia's invasion of Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "The text explicitly frames the U.S. as pursuing its own economic interests in Ukraine, implying that the West is driving the conflict to exploit Ukraine's resources rather than acknowledging Russia's role as the invader. This shifts blame to the West for the war's continuation."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by further implicating the West (and Ukraine's leadership) in the conflict's motives, portraying them as exploitative and corrupt.

      "reasoning": "The text explicitly directs the reader to Sputnik's infographics while implying that Western media (e.g., CBS News) is distorting or omitting the true motives behind Western involvement in Ukraine. This suggests that Western media is serving as a propaganda tool to obscure the real economic interests at play, aligning with the subnarrative definition."

      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western narratives (e.g., Graham's statements) as manipulative and self-serving.

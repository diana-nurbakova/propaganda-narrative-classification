      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The SEC must stop overreaching in this area and allow private ordering under corporate law to reestablish shareholder proposals as ways to enhance economic efficiency rather than diminish it.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the regulatory approach of the SEC regarding climate-related shareholder proposals, implying that such policies are economically detrimental and overreach, which aligns with the definition of criticizing the effectiveness and economic impact of climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the competence and integrity of the SEC, framing its regulatory approach as 'lawless,' which fits the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities in relation to climate change."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The shareholder proposal process has gone too far. How else to interpret the proposal recently sponsored by the climate activist investors Arjuna Capital and Follow This at ExxonMobil...",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the motives and impact of climate activist investors, portraying their actions as excessive and disruptive, which aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the proposed emission reduction targets would force ExxonMobil to abandon significant business operations, indirectly criticizing the feasibility and economic impact of transitioning to greener technologies or practices."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly suggests that implementing the climate-related shareholder proposal would force ExxonMobil to abandon a major economic investment and reduce its operational scale, implying a negative economic outcome."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The rationale for this type of proposal is baffling. The company’s board and its Environment, Safety and Public Policy Committee regularly engage with senior management on climate matters. Moreover, ExxonMobil provides a comprehensive annual report on its historical performance and goals for reducing GHG emissions over time.",
      "reasoning": "The text argues that the company is already addressing climate matters and setting its own emission reduction goals, implying that the activist proposal is unnecessary and thus ineffective in achieving additional meaningful environmental progress."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the regulatory framework enabling climate-related shareholder proposals but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by implying that climate policies (in this case, shareholder-driven ones) are a result of overreach rather than sound governance or environmental concern."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the SEC, a national governmental authority in the U.S., for its handling of the shareholder proposal process, framing its regulatory approach as 'permissive and arguably lawless.' This aligns with the definition of criticizing national governments' handling of issues related to corporate governance and climate policy."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "How else to interpret the proposal recently sponsored by the climate activist investors Arjuna Capital and Follow This at ExxonMobil...",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the climate activist investors Arjuna Capital and Follow This, which are political or advocacy organizations, for their role in the shareholder proposal process. This discredits these organizations in the context of the climate change debate, fitting the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "We argue that the SEC must stop overreaching in this area and allow private ordering under corporate law to reestablish shareholder proposals as ways to enhance economic efficiency rather than diminish it.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by criticizing the SEC's overreach but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of criticism of the EU, international entities, national governments, or political organizations. It focuses on institutional overreach broadly, warranting the use of 'Other.'"
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that the climate movement's demands are unrealistic and exaggerated, implying that the proposed emission reduction targets are alarmist and would lead to extreme, impractical consequences for the company."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement's influence on regulatory processes, suggesting that their actions undermine corporate law and governance. While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly highlights the financial and operational costs associated with accelerating emission reductions, implying that the proposed green transition is economically burdensome and thus aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy (or green transitions) is costly."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the regulatory framework supporting green initiatives (shareholder proposals on emissions) but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by framing green technology advocacy as overreach or misguided, without directly addressing cost, reliability, or danger."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "The restructuring was completed in November 2015 with a swap into new bonds and GDP warrants. In December 2015, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved a moratorium on paying off $3 billion of Russian debt.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly praise Russia, the mention of the moratorium on Russian debt is framed in a way that indirectly acknowledges Russia's role as a creditor, which could be interpreted as a subtle normalization of Russia's position in the financial context. However, this does not strongly fit the narrative, so this may not be the best example. No stronger evidence of explicit praise for Russia is present."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants. The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine, and, first and foremost, Ukraine's membership in NATO.",
      "reasoning": "The text excessively lauds the 'free world' (a term often used to refer to Western countries) by portraying it as the savior of democracy and framing its support as essential to Ukraine's victory. This aligns with the definition of overpraising the West."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "According to the current International Monetary Fund-supported program (Q2, 2023 – Q1, 2027), Ukraine’s need for external financial assistance is estimated at $122 billion. However, over two years of the full-scale war, partners have already disbursed $100 billion annually. Therefore, the $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the adequacy of Western financial support by labeling the IMF's estimate as 'misleading' and implying that Western partners are not providing sufficient or realistic assistance. This undermines Western diplomatic and financial efforts."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The text predicts adverse outcomes for Western cities (e.g., destruction of hospitals) if Ukraine does not receive adequate support, thereby framing the consequences of inaction as a direct threat to the West. This aligns with the narrative of highlighting negative consequences for the West."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implicitly praises Russian military might by framing it as a significant threat capable of attacking multiple European cities, thereby emphasizing the scale and destructive potential of Russia's military capabilities."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "While the text primarily criticizes Russia's actions, the mention of 'Russia’s initial invasion' as a historical fact without explicit condemnation in this context subtly reinforces the narrative of Russia's geopolitical influence and power, which aligns with the parent narrative but does not fit any specific subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Western-aligned nations (the 'free world') as morally superior and on the 'right side of history' by framing their support for Ukraine as a fight against tyranny and for democracy and justice."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support",
      "evidence_quote": "The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine, and, first and foremost, Ukraine's membership in NATO.",
      "reasoning": "This statement emphasizes the 'unity of the free world' and 'unwavering long-term military and financial support,' suggesting widespread and strong international backing for Western policies and actions, particularly in support of Ukraine."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by framing Western cities and values as under threat from Russia, implying that Western intervention is not only justified but necessary to protect civilization. While it aligns with the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other.'"
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "Some believe that since Ukraine receives large amounts of international aid, it can be used to settle with bondholders.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western financial assistance to Ukraine is disproportionate or excessive, implying that bondholders (often Western entities) are being unfairly pressured to accommodate Ukraine's demands. This aligns with the subnarrative that the West is overreacting to Ukraine's situation."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "However, over two-thirds of financial assistance arrives as loans to be redeemed. Importantly, international assistance funds are intended to support Ukraine, its economy, and its military to withstand the war.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that Western financial aid is structured in a way that prioritizes Western financial interests (loans to be repaid) over Ukraine's immediate needs, suggesting that the West is more concerned with its own economic gains than Ukraine's survival or victory."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The optimistic assessment of Ukraine’s external aid needs... the $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs. At least $400 billion is needed to avoid loss.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western institutions (e.g., the IMF) for underestimating Ukraine's financial needs, implying that the West is either incompetent or unwilling to provide adequate support. While it supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West, it does not fit neatly into any of the provided subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that if Ukraine does not receive sufficient financial support (including debt restructuring), the conflict could escalate and directly harm Western cities, implying that Western inaction or insufficient support could lead to catastrophic consequences for the West itself. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western policies (or lack thereof) will backfire."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants... Democracy and a just world order are the pillars of global economic sustainability, ensuring investment safety and security and investor profits worldwide.",
      "reasoning": "This broader argument frames Ukraine's struggle as existential for the West, implying that failure to support Ukraine would undermine global democracy, economic stability, and security. While it supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows, thus qualifying for 'Other'."

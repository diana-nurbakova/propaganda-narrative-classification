      "evidence_quote": "As Ukraine endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion, the impact extends far beyond the physical destruction of its cities and the displacement of its people.",
      "reasoning": "While the text explicitly mentions 'Russia's full-scale invasion,' the focus is on the consequences for Ukraine rather than directly attributing blame to Russia for starting the war. However, this quote does not shift blame away from Russia, so this narrative does not strongly apply. Re-evaluating, this narrative is not clearly present in the text."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "This crisis in healthcare is set against a backdrop of long-standing distrust in mental health services in Ukraine, a legacy of the Soviet era when the psychiatric system was used to oppress dissidents and enemies of the state.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights a historical and systemic issue within Ukraine's mental health services, which could be interpreted as undermining the effectiveness or legitimacy of Ukraine's healthcare system. This aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine by focusing on a perceived weakness or failure."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "N/A",
      "reasoning": "There are no statements in the text that portray Russia as unfairly targeted or victimized. The focus is entirely on the impact of the war on Ukraine and its population."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "N/A",
      "reasoning": "The text does not mention or predict any adverse outcomes for Western countries or their interests. The focus remains on Ukraine's internal challenges."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The full-scale invasion has magnified Ukraine's pre-existing challenges and introduced larger societal issues. The collective impact of population displacement, healthcare infrastructure destruction, and economic hardships contributes significantly to the deteriorating mental health of the society. Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear and anxiety about the prolonged and uncertain nature of the war, its societal impact, and the lack of a foreseeable resolution. It aligns with the definition of amplifying war-related fears by emphasizing the dire and ongoing consequences of the conflict."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "Nonetheless, Ukrainian resilience knows no limits, and the people will endure whatever it takes for the cause of victory, as the sacrifices being made are endless for its people.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly blame the West, the framing of 'the cause of victory' and 'endless sacrifices' subtly implies that external forces (potentially the West) are prolonging the conflict, thereby shifting indirect responsibility away from Russia as the invader. This aligns with the subnarrative by suggesting that Ukrainians are enduring hardship due to external pressures rather than Russia's aggression."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The ongoing war in Ukraine has also significantly impacted the nation's healthcare infrastructure, particularly affecting mental health services.",
      "reasoning": "The text repeatedly attributes the mental health crisis and societal trauma to the 'ongoing war' without explicitly naming Russia as the aggressor in every instance. This general framing supports the parent narrative by implying the war is a shared or external burden rather than a direct consequence of Russia's invasion. This does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but still aligns with the broader goal of deflecting blame."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "The full-scale invasion has magnified Ukraine's pre-existing challenges and introduced larger societal issues. The collective impact of population displacement, healthcare infrastructure destruction, and economic hardships contributes significantly to the deteriorating mental health of the society. Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly portrays Ukraine as facing insurmountable challenges with no clear resolution, emphasizing the lack of a positive future outlook. It aligns with the definition of the subnarrative by suggesting that the situation is dire and without hope."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Those registered as internally displaced people (IDPs) can receive a monthly allowance of UAH 2,000 ($52.77) per adult and UAH 3,000 ($79.15) per child from the program that was created by the government. The challenges within Ukraine extend beyond physical dangers. Financial hardships are widespread, with 78% reporting reduced incomes and a third losing jobs due to the war. Government aid doesn’t help much.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the Ukrainian government's policies and effectiveness, particularly in addressing the needs of internally displaced people and economic hardships. It portrays the government as inadequate and ineffective, fitting the subnarrative's definition."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The mental toll of Russia's invasion on Ukrainians is profound. In June 2022, Health Minister Viktor Liashko predicted that around 15 million Ukrainians would need psychological support, with up to 4 million requiring medical treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) also found that 1 in 5 Ukrainians couldn’t get the medication they needed; cost, availability, and long queues at local pharmacies are the top three reasons.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting systemic failures in Ukraine (e.g., healthcare access), it does not neatly fit any of the specific subnarratives. It underscores broader societal collapse without directly discrediting the government, military, or associating Ukraine with criminality or Nazism, thus warranting the 'Other' classification."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence",
      "evidence_quote": "As Ukraine endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion, the impact extends far beyond the physical destruction of its cities and the displacement of its people.",
      "reasoning": "The phrasing 'endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion' subtly frames Russia's actions as a reaction rather than an unprovoked aggression, aligning with the subnarrative that Russia's actions are justified as self-defence."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The mental toll of Russia's invasion on Ukrainians is profound... Russia’s war against Ukraine has led to significant territorial occupation, destruction of homes, and one of the largest migration crises this century.",
      "reasoning": "While the text describes the consequences of Russia's invasion, it does not explicitly attribute blame or aggression to Russia. Instead, it frames the conflict in a way that could imply Russia is reacting to external pressures or provocations, supporting the parent narrative without fitting a specific subnarrative."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: The conflict will increase the Ukrainian refugee flows to Europe",
      "evidence_quote": "Those who fled to western Ukraine speak to the extremely high rent prices due to high demand, and government aid doesn’t help much. [...] The separation and the fear of return, especially to areas constantly under missile strikes, adds a significant mental burden to Ukrainians. [...] Over time, these families often adapt to life in their new countries, with children assimilating and over time, they no longer identify Ukraine as their home anymore.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the challenges faced by Ukrainian refugees, including financial hardships and the difficulty of returning to Ukraine due to ongoing conflict. It also emphasizes the long-term integration of Ukrainian families into foreign countries, which implies a potential increase in refugee flows to Europe and their prolonged stay, aligning with the subnarrative of catastrophizing refugee outflows due to the conflict."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The mental toll of Russia's invasion on Ukrainians is profound. [...] The destruction of infrastructure and economic downturn complicates access to quality mental health services, a critical issue as the country grapples with the widespread societal trauma caused by the war. [...] The collective impact of population displacement, healthcare infrastructure destruction, and economic hardships contributes significantly to the deteriorating mental health of the society.",
      "reasoning": "While the text primarily focuses on the internal consequences of the war for Ukraine, it also implicitly suggests broader destabilizing effects that could indirectly impact the West. The emphasis on societal trauma, economic hardship, and infrastructure collapse paints a picture of a prolonged crisis that may strain Western support systems, humanitarian aid, and geopolitical stability. This does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but still supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West."

      "evidence_quote": "The mental toll of Russia's invasion on Ukrainians is profound... Russia’s war against Ukraine has led to significant territorial occupation, destruction of homes, and one of the largest migration crises this century.",
      "reasoning": "While the text primarily focuses on the mental health crisis in Ukraine, the framing of Russia's actions as a 'war against Ukraine' with 'significant territorial occupation' and the broader context of destruction and displacement implicitly suggests a threat that could extend beyond Ukraine, aligning with the subnarrative that Russia may attack other countries."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The ongoing war in Ukraine has also significantly impacted the nation's healthcare infrastructure... In 2022, there were 707 documented attacks on Ukrainian health care facilities, resulting in significant destruction of or damage to 218 hospitals and clinics... The destruction of infrastructure and economic downturn complicates access to quality mental health services, a critical issue as the country grapples with the widespread societal trauma caused by the war.",
      "reasoning": "The text amplifies war-related fears by emphasizing the scale of destruction, societal trauma, and the long-term consequences of the war on Ukraine's stability and future. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement by implying that their goals are unrealistic and dangerous, leading to catastrophic outcomes. While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks,' thus qualifying for 'Other.'"

      "evidence_quote": "The theory that climate fanatics have adopted as to why this is all happening blames human activity and industry, even though the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that climate policies targeting human activity and industry are misguided and ineffective because natural sources (e.g., volcanoes) contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies fail to achieve their intended environmental goals."

      "reasoning": "This phrase frames climate activism as part of a broader, irrational apocalyptic narrative, which criticizes climate policies but does not fit the specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motives. It supports the parent narrative in a distinct way, warranting inclusion under 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by framing green technology advocacy (e.g., stopping oil use) as dangerous and catastrophic, but it does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'dangerous,' 'unreliable,' or 'costly.' It instead focuses on the broader catastrophic consequences of transitioning away from fossil fuels, which aligns with the 'Other' subnarrative."

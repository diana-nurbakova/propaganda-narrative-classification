      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the competence and actions of German authorities and institutions in handling the coal mine expansion and the associated protests, implying they are acting in a manner that is shameful or inappropriate."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "She and other activists say expanding the coal mine would contribute to the climate crisis and be counterproductive to Germany’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "reasoning": "This statement questions the effectiveness and motives behind Germany's recent approval of coal expansion projects, suggesting they undermine climate goals and policies."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Video captured at the protest showed three officers carrying a seemingly unbothered Thunberg, 20, away from the demonstration... Interactions between the activists and police have grown violent at times, resulting in the hospitalizations of at least nine demonstrators.",
      "reasoning": "While not a direct criticism from the text itself, the framing of the protest interactions as violent and the portrayal of Thunberg as 'seemingly unbothered' could be interpreted as subtly undermining the seriousness or legitimacy of the climate movement's actions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the German government's actions and policies, specifically in the context of climate change and the expansion of the coal mine, which aligns with the definition of disapproving national governments' handling of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The country has pledged to phase out coal power generation by 2030, but it also recently approved coal expansion projects, saying they’re necessary to maintain the country’s energy security as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to disrupt oil and gas supplies.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the inconsistency and perceived hypocrisy of political organizations and figures in Germany regarding their climate commitments, which fits the subnarrative of discrediting political entities in the climate change debate."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Video captured at the protest showed three officers carrying a seemingly unbothered Thunberg, 20, away from the demonstration... Interactions between the activists and police have grown violent at times, resulting in the hospitalizations of at least nine demonstrators.",
      "reasoning": "This part of the text criticizes the actions of law enforcement (an authority) in handling the protest, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives. It highlights the heavy-handed response of police, which can be seen as a broader criticism of institutional authority."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "She and other activists say expanding the coal mine would contribute to the climate crisis and be counterproductive to Germany’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly implies that Germany's climate policies (e.g., phasing out coal by 2030) are being undermined by contradictory actions (coal mine expansion), suggesting the policies are ineffective in achieving their environmental goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The country has pledged to phase out coal power generation by 2030, but it also recently approved coal expansion projects, saying they’re necessary to maintain the country’s energy security as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to disrupt oil and gas supplies.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights that Germany's climate policies are being compromised due to economic and energy security concerns, implying that strict adherence to climate policies could harm the economy or energy stability."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Germany's handling of climate policies and protests but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative categories. It supports the parent narrative by implying mismanagement or failure in climate policy implementation."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Video captured at the protest showed three officers carrying a seemingly unbothered Thunberg, 20, away from the demonstration",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'seemingly unbothered' subtly undermines Thunberg's commitment or seriousness, implying she is not genuinely concerned about the protest or its cause. This attacks her reputation rather than addressing the substance of her activism."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Interactions between the activists and police have grown violent at times, resulting in the hospitalizations of at least nine demonstrators.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by portraying the climate movement's actions as disruptive or harmful, without directly fitting into the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks. It implies the movement is responsible for escalating tensions, which indirectly criticizes its methods."

      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'notorious' and the emphasis on Ukrainian aircraft carrying missiles portrays Ukraine as an aggressive actor, undermining its legitimacy and intentions."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainian aircraft armed with Storm Shadow missiles are taking off to attack Russian rear areas.",
      "reasoning": "By mentioning Storm Shadow missiles, which are Western-supplied, the text implies Western involvement in enabling Ukrainian aggression, indirectly criticizing Western support for Ukraine."

More explosions thundered in the area of the notorious Starokonstantinov airfield in the Khmelnitsk region. Ukrainian Su-24MR aircraft of the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade are based at there. They are the main carriers of Storm Shadow / SCALP cruise missiles.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for the conflict by emphasizing that Ukrainian aircraft are using Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to attack Russian rear areas, implying that the West is enabling and escalating the aggression rather than Russia being the primary aggressor."

      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Ukraine as the aggressor by highlighting Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian territory, thereby shifting responsibility for the conflict away from Russia's invasion and onto Ukraine's defensive actions."

      "evidence_quote": "Avdeevka, which was turned into a large stronghold by the Ukrainian military during the war in Donbass.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase subtly supports the parent narrative by implying that Ukraine fortified Avdeevka in a way that provoked or justified Russian military action, without explicitly fitting the other subnarrative definitions. It suggests Ukraine's actions in Donbass are a contributing factor to the conflict."

      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting Ukrainian military actions, it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It subtly undermines Ukraine by framing its military operations as provocative or ineffective without direct discrediting language."

Russian forces managed to advance from the recently captured ash dump and take control of the facilities on the northern outskirts of the large Coke and Chemical Plant.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the scale, effectiveness, and strategic success of Russian military operations, including strikes on Ukrainian airfields and advances in Avdeevka. This directly aligns with the definition of praising Russia’s military institutions, equipment, and operational capabilities."

Ukrainian forces attempted to reach Russian territory with UAVs... two Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the Bryansk region, three more over the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea",
      "reasoning": "The text emphasizes the success of Russian attacks while downplaying Ukrainian efforts (e.g., drone strikes being intercepted) and framing Russian actions as precise (no civilian casualties). This supports the parent narrative of praising Russia but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions."

      "reasoning": "The text highlights Russian military advances and the capture of strategic positions, implying that Western-backed Ukrainian forces are unable to effectively resist or counter Russian offensives, thus portraying the West as militarily weak or ineffective in supporting Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "The focus on Western-supplied missiles (Storm Shadow/SCALP) and their use by Ukraine suggests that the text is framing Western support as self-serving, aimed at prolonging conflict for strategic interests rather than genuinely aiding Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "This passage undermines Ukrainian authorities by suggesting they are concealing information, which indirectly discredits Western-aligned governance in Ukraine. While it supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West, it does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives, hence the use of 'Other'."

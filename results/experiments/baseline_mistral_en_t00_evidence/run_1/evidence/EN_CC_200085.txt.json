    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title itself frames the wind energy initiative as a 'ripoff,' implying that the climate policy (offshore wind energy development) is ineffective, wasteful, or economically harmful. This directly questions the value and motives behind climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'ripoff' in the title suggests skepticism or criticism of wind energy technology, portraying it as flawed or overhyped. This aligns with the narrative of expressing skepticism about environmentally friendly technologies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The framing of the announcement as a 'ripoff' challenges the competence or integrity of the institutions and authorities (e.g., the Biden-Harris administration, Department of the Interior) involved in promoting offshore wind energy. This implies that their actions are not in the public's best interest."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff… The lease sale represents the third major offshore wind lease sale this year and the first ever for the Pacific region. Today’s sale drew competitive high bids from 5 companies totaling $757.1 million, well exceeding the first lease sales that were held in the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff' and the emphasis on the high monetary value of the bids ($757.1 million) suggest that the policy is driven by financial gain for companies rather than genuine environmental concerns. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies are only for profit."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'ripoff' implies that the policy is wasteful or detrimental to economic interests, suggesting a negative economic impact. This supports the subnarrative that climate policies harm the economy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The interest and success of today’s sale represents a significant milestone toward achieving President Biden’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 and 15 gigawatts of floating offshore wind capacity by 2035.",
      "reasoning": "While the official statements highlight the goals and benefits of the policy, the framing of the headline and the dismissive tone toward the initiative suggest skepticism about the policy's overall value or intent, which does not neatly fit the other subnarratives but still supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "The lease sale represents the third major offshore wind lease sale this year and the first ever for the Pacific region. Today’s sale drew competitive high bids from 5 companies totaling $757.1 million, well exceeding the first lease sales that were held in the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the high financial cost of the offshore wind lease sale, implying that renewable energy projects require substantial investment, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title of the text explicitly frames the offshore wind energy initiative as a 'ripoff,' suggesting a broader critique of green technologies that does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative categories but supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title explicitly frames the offshore wind energy auction as a 'ripoff,' which directly criticizes the national government's (U.S.) handling of climate-related initiatives, implying mismanagement or inefficacy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The Biden-Harris administration believes that to address the climate crisis head on, we must unleash a new era of clean, reliable energy that serves every household in America.",
      "reasoning": "While the quote itself is neutral, the framing of the article with the title 'The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff' suggests an intent to discredit the Biden-Harris administration's climate policies and initiatives, aligning with criticism of political figures and organizations."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The interest and success of today’s sale represents a significant milestone toward achieving President Biden’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 and 15 gigawatts of floating offshore wind capacity by 2035.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'significant milestone' is presented in a context where the overarching tone of the article (as suggested by the title) undermines the legitimacy or value of the administration's goals. This supports the parent narrative of criticism but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other.'"

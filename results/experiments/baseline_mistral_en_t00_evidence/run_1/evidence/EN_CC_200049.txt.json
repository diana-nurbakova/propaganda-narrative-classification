      "evidence_quote": "The group’s assertion that in the U.S. most weather-related deaths ‘are caused by heat’ does not stand up to scrutiny, however, since the majority of weather-related deaths come from cold, not heat.",
      "reasoning": "This quote minimizes the significance of heat-related deaths and climate change impacts by emphasizing that cold-related deaths are more prevalent, thereby downplaying the urgency of climate change concerns."

      "reasoning": "This quote raises doubts about the scientific claims regarding heat-related deaths by presenting contrasting data, thereby questioning the validity of the measurements and conclusions drawn by climate scientists."

      "evidence_quote": "Alarmists Warn of U.S. ‘Heat Dome’ Tied to Human-Induced Climate Change",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'alarmists' in the headline challenges the motives and integrity of those advocating for climate action, framing them as overly dramatic or exaggerated in their concerns."

      "reasoning": "While this section is presented as a critique, it initially amplifies fears by quoting sources that emphasize dire consequences of climate change, such as increased heat-related deaths and risks to millions, before attempting to counter them."

      "reasoning": "The quote emphasizes that cold-related deaths far outnumber heat-related deaths, implying that the temperature increase due to climate change is not having a significant negative impact on mortality rates."

      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that despite global warming, the overall impact on mortality has been mitigated by a larger decrease in cold-related deaths, implying adaptation to temperature changes."

      "reasoning": "This statement challenges the significance of heat-related deaths as evidence of climate change impacts but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by undermining claims about the severity of climate change effects."

It added that over the past 20 years, the death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the impact of temperature increases (global warming) is minimal or offset by other factors, suggesting the data does not support a significant or concerning rise in heat-related harm."

      "reasoning": "While this quote is part of the broader narrative questioning the science, it does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by framing the original claims as alarmist without directly addressing methodologies, data, or specific scientific assertions."

      "reasoning": "The headline and subsequent text frame the climate movement as exaggerating the severity of heat-related risks by using the term 'alarmists,' which directly suggests the movement is overstating threats for dramatic effect."

      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by amplifying climate fears, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided. It emphasizes the urgency and severity of climate change impacts without explicitly predicting uninhabitability, doomsday scenarios, or futility of action."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for Germany's economic struggles away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and instead attributes the negative consequences to the sanctions imposed by the West and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, implying that the West is responsible for the crisis."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error. While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western (specifically German) leadership and policies, portraying them as hypocritical, ineffective, and self-destructive, while contrasting them with the pragmatic approaches of non-Western countries like China."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The German economy, the fourth-largest in the world, has ground to a standstill. There is no growth. Manufacturing is depressed, trade is weak, inflation is high, and jobs are scarce. Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights adverse economic outcomes for Germany (a Western country), attributing its decline to energy policies and the broader geopolitical context, which aligns with the narrative of predicting or reporting negative consequences for the West."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Virtue-Signaling Straight Into the Abyss",
      "reasoning": "While not a direct quote, the subheading 'Virtue-Signaling Straight Into the Abyss' implies a critique of Western media and political narratives, suggesting they are driven by performative moralizing rather than practical or factual considerations, thereby fostering distrust in mainstream discourse."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "facing intense pressure from green politicians and evangelists of a looming climate apocalypse, Germany embarked on a plan to completely eliminate coal and other fossil fuels from its energy complex.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Germany's energy policies were influenced by hidden agendas or secret schemes of powerful groups (e.g., 'green politicians and evangelists of a looming climate apocalypse'), implying a manipulative or conspiratorial motive behind climate action."

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for Germany's economic struggles onto the 'sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West,' portraying the West as the aggressors responsible for the negative consequences rather than Russia's invasion of Ukraine."

      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not directly blame Ukraine or the West, it reinforces the parent narrative by emphasizing the negative impact of the 'disruption of Russian gas' without explicitly acknowledging Russia's role as the invader or the cause of the disruption. This subtly supports the broader theme of deflecting responsibility from Russia."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the West's response to Russia's actions (sanctions and pipeline sabotage) is disproportionate and harmful to Germany, implying an overreaction that has led to economic hardship."

While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that Western (specifically German) leaders are prioritizing symbolic climate goals over the well-being of their own citizens, suggesting that their support for Ukraine (via sanctions) is not about Ukraine itself but about advancing their own ideological interests."

      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights disparities within the EU, suggesting that member states are affected differently by the sanctions regime, implying division in their ability to respond cohesively to the crisis."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by discrediting the West's handling of the energy crisis but does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It emphasizes the negative consequences of Western policies on European economies, reinforcing the broader theme of Western incompetence or malfeasance."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly links the Western sanctions on Russia to negative economic consequences for Germany, such as the need to find alternative (and more expensive) energy sources. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western sanctions will backfire by harming the economies of Western countries themselves."

Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It highlights broader economic suffering (high electricity prices and inflation) in Europe due to the conflict and sanctions, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific subnarratives provided."

      "reasoning": "The text implies that Western (including German) media and leadership are promoting a misleading or hypocritical narrative about climate policy, suggesting they are instruments of propaganda that prioritize 'virtue-signaling' over economic reality. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The proposed solution of German leaders has been for its citizens to consume less and its factories to produce less or move manufacturing offshore. But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders?",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by criticizing Western (German) leadership and implying they are misled or misleading, but it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided. It suggests a broader distrust of the narratives promoted by Western institutions without directly targeting media or Ukrainian media."

      "evidence_quote": "the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the economic downturn in Germany is not merely a result of poor policy decisions but is instead influenced by hidden, coordinated actions by powerful groups (e.g., the U.S. and Western allies) imposing sanctions and potentially sabotaging infrastructure. This aligns with the broader narrative of secret schemes by powerful groups manipulating global events."

      "reasoning": "This quote implies that Germany's economic suffering is part of a deliberate or unfair global dynamic where other nations (e.g., China) are allowed to prioritize their economic growth while Germany is pressured into self-destructive policies. This suggests a hidden agenda or unequal treatment by global powers, reinforcing the parent narrative."

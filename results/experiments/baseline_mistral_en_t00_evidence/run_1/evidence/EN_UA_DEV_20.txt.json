      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame away from Russia by suggesting that the UK and US are responsible for prolonging the war, rather than acknowledging Russia's initial invasion as the root cause."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western countries (US and Europe) for escalating the conflict, portraying their actions as reckless and counterproductive, which aligns with discrediting Western diplomacy."

      "reasoning": "This quote predicts adverse outcomes for the West (and the world) by implying that their actions are increasing the risk of a nuclear catastrophe, which is a negative consequence."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin is showing this interest even though the Russian military is in a strong position that seems likely to get even stronger.",
      "reasoning": "This quote subtly portrays Russia as willing to negotiate despite its military strength, implying that Russia is being reasonable and victimized by the West's refusal to engage in diplomacy."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the continuation of the war onto the U.S. and U.K., portraying them as the ones who sabotaged a potential peace deal, thereby framing the West as the aggressors prolonging the conflict."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by blaming the Ukrainian government and its Western backers for escalating the conflict, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It implies that the war's prolongation is due to actions by Ukraine and the West, rather than Russia's initial invasion."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the U.S. and U.K. prioritized their own strategic interests (e.g., weakening Russia) over Ukraine's immediate well-being, implying they disregarded Ukraine's fate in favor of their own geopolitical goals."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly describes Western actions (e.g., allowing Ukraine to strike inside Russia, testing ICBMs) as 'strategically pointless provocations,' framing them as disproportionate and unnecessary escalations."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that Western leaders are unwilling to engage in meaningful diplomacy, instead pursuing military solutions that are portrayed as unrealistic and counterproductive."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden called Russian president Vladamir Putin a tyrant who invaded Ukraine simply because he is 'bent on domination.' Biden then renewed one of his favorite tropes, asserting that if Ukraine falls, its people will be subjugated, its neighbors will be in immediate danger, and all of Europe will be threatened by Putin’s aggressive ambitions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Western rhetoric (e.g., framing Putin as a global threat) as exaggerated and manipulative, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It discredits the West's diplomatic messaging without directly addressing division, weakness, fatigue, or overreaction."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western sanctions or policies aimed at weakening Russia have not achieved their intended effect. Instead, Russia has adapted and increased its military production, implying that Western actions are counterproductive and may harm the West's strategic position."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting the broader negative consequences of prolonging the conflict, such as increased global instability and the risk of nuclear escalation. While it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, it clearly aligns with the theme of negative outcomes for the West and the world."
    },

      "evidence_quote": "Putin is showing this interest even though the Russian military is in a strong position that seems likely to get even stronger.",
      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that Russia's actions are defensive rather than aggressive, as it implies Russia is only acting to protect its interests and is not the instigator of the conflict. The context further supports this by downplaying Russia's offensive actions and emphasizing its willingness to negotiate."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic",
      "evidence_quote": "But the West’s chosen depiction of Putin as a tyrant bent on conquering the entire European continent suffered its latest setback last month when it came out that the Russian president is interested in halting the fighting and negotiating a deal that recognizes the current battlefield lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the Western portrayal of Putin and Russia, framing it as an unfair or exaggerated narrative driven by russophobia rather than factual evidence. It suggests that the West's negative stance toward Russia is based on prejudice rather than Russia's actual actions."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "One month after Russia invaded in early 2022, both sides reached an agreement where Russia would pull back to preinvasion boundaries and, in return, Ukraine would agree to not seek NATO membership. The deal could have put an end to the fighting and handed Kyiv control of all the land Russia had just seized. But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as a victim of Western interference, as it suggests that Russia was willing to negotiate and de-escalate but was undermined by the U.S. and U.K. This argument does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions but clearly supports the idea that Russia is the victim of external forces."

      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly warns that continued escalation in the conflict could lead to a catastrophic nuclear accident, which aligns with the fear of a broader, potentially world-ending conflict (WWIII)."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden then renewed one of his favorite tropes, asserting that if Ukraine falls, its people will be subjugated, its neighbors will be in immediate danger, and all of Europe will be threatened by Putin’s aggressive ambitions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Russia's aggression will not stop at Ukraine but will extend to neighboring countries and all of Europe, amplifying the fear of further attacks."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "the US then test-fired two nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles... The escalations have not been one-sided. Russia conducted drills simulating the use of strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus... nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "These quotes highlight the explicit mention of nuclear drills, missile tests, and the risk of a nuclear accident, evoking fear of nuclear weapons being employed in the conflict."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote indicates direct involvement or endorsement of NATO-provided weapons being used in strikes within Russia, suggesting NATO's direct intervention in the conflict."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by emphasizing the risks and escalations of the conflict but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. It underscores the broader theme of amplifying war-related fears through escalatory actions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin is showing this interest even though the Russian military is in a strong position that seems likely to get even stronger.",
      "reasoning": "While the quote does not directly claim the Russian army is collapsing, the surrounding context emphasizes Russia's military strength, artillery dominance, and production capabilities, which indirectly counters the subnarrative of collapse. However, the parent narrative is still supported by the broader argument that Ukraine is weakening, which could imply relative Russian strength. This does not fit the subnarrative definition, so it is not directly applicable."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army will lose all the occupied territories",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly states that Ukraine lacks the capability to reclaim all occupied territories, directly contradicting the subnarrative that Russia will lose all occupied territories. Thus, this subnarrative is not present."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia’s minefields, artillery, and punishing glide bombs have not only kept Ukrainian forces from advancing but left them struggling to hold their positions along the current front line. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers that no amount of foreign aid or equipment transfers can do anything to alleviate... As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "This quote provides clear evidence of the Ukrainian military's declining effectiveness, strength, and morale, directly supporting the subnarrative that the Ukrainian army is collapsing."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained. Recently, the Russians even launched a brand new incursion into territory around the northeastern city of Kharkiv—territory that had already been recaptured by the Ukrainians in late 2022.",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on war outcomes by highlighting Ukraine's territorial losses and Russia's advances, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific subnarratives of Russian or Ukrainian army collapse or loss of occupied territories. It is thus classified under 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the policy is driven by financial or corporate interests (e.g., partnerships with Chinese corporations) rather than purely environmental concerns, aligning with the subnarrative that climate policies are for profit."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Gotion Inc., linked to the CCP, plans to build a $2.4 billion EV battery plant in the Big Rapids, Michigan, area at Whitmer’s behest. The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",

(CATL) — China’s premiere battery supplier with deep ties to the CCP. Most recently, Ford announced that it was already cutting job and investment projections for the project.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing Whitmer's administration for its handling of international partnerships (specifically with Chinese entities) in the context of climate policy, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It extends the criticism beyond political figures to broader institutional decisions."

      "reasoning": "This section criticizes the political and social implications of the green technology transition, specifically the involvement of foreign entities and local opposition, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit into the predefined subnarratives.

(CATL) — China’s premiere battery supplier with deep ties to the CCP.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly links Michigan's green policy (transitioning to electric vehicles) with investments from Chinese corporations tied to the CCP, framing these relations as exploitative and abusive. It highlights the unpopularity of these investments among locals and the use of taxpayer subsidies, suggesting economic and political exploitation under the guise of green policies."

      "evidence_quote": "Michigan is on the cutting-edge of mobility and electrification. Our world-leading auto industry is making the switch to electric, and we continue to attract battery, semiconductor, and clean energy investments from other states and nations. We must usher the future of mobility and clean energy into Michigan by winning projects and leading by example in state government.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'abusive/exploitative relations' or 'neo-colonialism,' it supports the parent narrative by framing green policies as a tool for geopolitical competition and economic influence, particularly in attracting investments from other states and nations. This suggests green policies are being used as instruments of geopolitical strategy, which aligns with the broader parent narrative but does not fit the predefined subnarratives precisely."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the effectiveness and practicality of Garcetti's decision to attend the climate summit in person, implying that the policy action (attending the summit) contradicts the goal of reducing carbon emissions and neglects local responsibilities."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti joined a U.S. Department of Transportation presentation on 'high-quality urban transportation infrastructure,' though L.A.’s infrastructure is not widely considered 'high-quality.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the competence and credibility of Garcetti and the institutions he represents by highlighting the discrepancy between his claims about infrastructure quality and the reality of L.A.'s infrastructure issues."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the motives and integrity of the climate movement by suggesting that the summit's in-person format is unnecessary and hypocritical, given the carbon emissions associated with travel."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses skepticism about the feasibility and public support for Garcetti's green technology policies, specifically the transition away from natural gas plants."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti joined a U.S. Department of Transportation presentation on 'high-quality urban transportation infrastructure,' though L.A.’s infrastructure is not widely considered 'high-quality.' A proposed high-speed rail between L.A. and San Francisco has been largely canceled, and current passenger rail service from L.A. to San Diego has been suspended because of a potential landslide hazard.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights the disconnect between Garcetti's advocacy for climate solutions (e.g., high-quality urban transportation) and the actual state of L.A.'s infrastructure, suggesting that the policies he promotes are not achieving their intended goals."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that the policy to shutter natural gas plants faces opposition due to potential economic consequences, such as job losses or disruptions to the energy sector, aligning with the subnarrative that climate policies harm the economy."

      "evidence_quote": "Los Angeles continued to struggle with the high crime and homelessness that have come to define his legacy, as well as a crisis in the City Council triggered by racist comments from City Council members within Garcetti’s party. It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes Garcetti's prioritization of international climate summits over local issues (e.g., crime, homelessness, and political crises), which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives. Additionally, the question about the necessity of in-person attendance implies hypocrisy or inefficiency in climate policy efforts."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined a 'global coalition of mayors' at a summit on climate change this week in Buenos Aires, Argentina, burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Mayor Garcetti, a political figure, for his actions in the context of climate change, implying hypocrisy and neglect of local responsibilities."

A proposed high-speed rail between L.A. and San Francisco has been largely canceled, and current passenger rail service from L.A. to San Diego has been suspended because of a potential landslide hazard.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the U.S. national government and its agencies for failing to deliver on infrastructure promises, contrasting it with Garcetti's participation in an international event."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group is an international network of nearly 100 of the world’s largest cities committed to concrete action to combat climate change.",
      "reasoning": "While not overtly critical, the framing of the article questions the efficacy and necessity of international entities like C40, particularly in the context of Garcetti's flight emissions and local issues."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase supports the parent narrative by questioning the necessity and practicality of international climate summits, which is a form of criticism not explicitly covered by the other subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "“When it comes to fighting the climate crisis, our commitments as cities, states, and countries are only as strong as the size and ambition of our global coalition,” said Mayor Eric Garcetti. “The C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action...”",
      "reasoning": "The quote emphasizes the urgency and 'make-or-break' framing of climate action, which aligns with the subnarrative that the climate movement exaggerates the severity of climate change for dramatic effect."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies that Garcetti's climate policies are driven by ulterior motives (e.g., political or financial interests) rather than genuine environmental concerns, as evidenced by opposition from unions and electoral failure."

It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes Garcetti's decision to fly internationally for a climate summit, highlighting the irony of his actions (burning fossil fuels) and questioning the necessity of in-person attendance. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives, as it focuses on hypocrisy rather than alarmism or corruption."

      "reasoning": "The quote highlights opposition to Garcetti's Green New Deal, implying that the transition to renewable energy (shuttering natural gas plants) is politically and economically costly, aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive or inefficient for widespread adoption."

      "evidence_quote": "burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home... It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes Garcetti for using fossil fuels to attend a climate summit, suggesting hypocrisy in climate action efforts. While this supports the parent narrative (controversy about green technologies), it does not fit the specific subnarratives of danger, unreliability, or cost, thus qualifying for 'Other'."

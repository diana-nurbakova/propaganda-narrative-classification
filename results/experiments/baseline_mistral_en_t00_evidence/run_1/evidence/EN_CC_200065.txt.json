      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely 'the hottest day in thousands of years.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'climate alarmists' is used pejoratively to challenge the motives and integrity of those advocating for climate action, implying they are exaggerating or sensationalizing the issue. This directly aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The text raises doubts about the scientific methods and data used to assert historical temperature records, specifically questioning the reliability of proxy records like tree rings and ice cores. This fits the definition of questioning the measurements and science."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase minimizes the significance of the scientific findings and implies that claims about record temperatures are exaggerated or dramatized, which aligns with the narrative of downplaying climate change."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "the once prestigious Lancet medical journal, which has averred that 2023 saw 'the highest global temperatures in over 100,000 years.'",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'once prestigious' challenges the integrity and competence of the Lancet, suggesting it has lost credibility. This is a direct criticism of an institution and authority in relation to climate change."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely 'the hottest day in thousands of years.' ... Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert that 2024 is 'the planet’s hottest year yet since at least the pre-industrial era, and likely for at least 100,000 years before that' ... These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly labels climate activists as 'alarmists' and critiques their claims as 'extravagant' and 'astonishing,' suggesting exaggeration of climate change severity. The focus on the dramatic language used by climate reporters and the dismissal of their claims as unsupported by direct data aligns with the definition of this subnarrative."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase implies that the climate movement prioritizes sensationalism over scientific rigor, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other subnarrative categories. It suggests ulterior motives (e.g., storytelling) without explicitly alleging corruption or attacking individuals."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Methodologies/metrics used are unreliable/faulty",
      "evidence_quote": "Although sporadic attempts to measure temperature were made previously, 'there are too few data before 1880 for scientists to estimate average temperatures for the entire planet,' NASA has concluded. Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, 'scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,' NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the reliability of methodologies and metrics used to estimate historical temperatures, particularly proxy records like tree rings and ice cores, by highlighting their fundamental differences from direct measurements and the lack of sufficient data before 1880."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Data shows no temperature increase",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The statement implies skepticism about claims of record-breaking temperatures by emphasizing the limited historical scope of direct temperature data, suggesting that assertions about temperatures over thousands of years lack robust evidence."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase undermines the credibility of the scientific claims presented in the article by suggesting that the narrative is driven by sensationalism rather than evidence, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Climate cycles are natural",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that current temperature records are insignificant in the context of Earth's long-term natural climate cycles, suggesting that climate change is a natural occurrence rather than a recent anomaly."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase dismisses the scientific basis of climate change claims, supporting the parent narrative by undermining the credibility of climate data and research without fitting a specific subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "The piece echoes claims by the once prestigious Lancet medical journal, which has averred that 2023 saw 'the highest global temperatures in over 100,000 years.' These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the Lancet medical journal, an international entity, for making claims about climate data that the author disputes. This aligns with the subnarrative of criticizing the role and influence of international entities on climate policy."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "'We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate keeps warming, we are bound to see new records being broken in future months and years,' states Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service in Europe.",
      "reasoning": "The text discredits Carlo Buontempo, a political figure associated with a climate change service, by framing his statement as part of an 'alarmist' narrative. This fits the subnarrative of criticizing political organizations and figures in the context of climate change debate."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase broadly criticizes institutions and authorities (e.g., media, scientists, or climate organizations) for prioritizing sensationalism over scientific rigor. While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided, warranting the use of 'Other.'"

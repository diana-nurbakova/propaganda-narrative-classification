      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the narrative of Russia's invasion being an 'imperial-style land grab' is a Western and Ukrainian fabrication, shifting blame away from Russia as the aggressor."

      "evidence_quote": "a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the West's inability to provide timely support to Ukraine, implying incompetence or lack of resolve in Western diplomatic and political efforts."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.",

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts responsibility for the conflict by implying that the West and Ukraine are falsely portraying Russia's actions as aggressive, while Russia's own expansionist claims (e.g., taking Kyiv and Odesa) are framed as justified. It suggests the West is the real aggressor by pushing a narrative that Russia is merely defending itself or reclaiming its territory."

      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev said Russia also wanted to take the Black Sea port of Odesa... 'Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city.'",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by justifying Russia's territorial ambitions as natural or historical, rather than framing them as an invasion. It implies that the war is not Russia's fault but rather a necessary reclamation of what is rightfully Russian, which does not fit the specific subnarratives but still shifts blame away from Russia as the invader."

      "evidence_quote": "Russian troops will go much further into Ukraine, taking the southern city of Odesa and might even one day push on to the capital Kyiv... After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization... Russia is now seeking to recapture the initiative across the 1,000 km (600-mile) front line, where its troops are dug in behind deep mine fields patrolled by drones and guarded by heavy artillery.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights Russia's military capabilities, territorial advances, and strategic positioning, portraying its forces as strong, resilient, and capable of further expansion. This directly aligns with the subnarrative of praising Russian military might."

      "reasoning": "Medvedev's statement frames the invasion as a reclaiming of historically and culturally Russian territory, implying broad national support for the military campaign. This aligns with the subnarrative of emphasizing strong national backing for the invasion."

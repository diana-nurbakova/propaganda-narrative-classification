    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act... the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, aligning with the definition of criticizing climate policies by highlighting potential negative consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021... The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "The text implicitly challenges the competence or priorities of major banks and institutions like the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance by framing their investment shifts as potentially misguided or insufficient, which aligns with criticism of institutions and authorities."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Deutsche bank in particular drew some criticism from activist groups that considered the move to be insufficient, since it did not include similar cutbacks in oil and gas... Activist groups had previously hailed the decision from major British bank HSBC in December to not fund new oil and gas investments",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the motives and impact of climate activist groups by highlighting their perceived inconsistency and pressure on financial institutions, fitting the definition of criticism of the climate movement."

      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks... submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of the Federal Reserve's involvement in climate-related financial regulations suggests that such policies could be used as tools for broader institutional control or geopolitical influence, aligning with the narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments."

      "evidence_quote": "(RELATED: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Shatter Record Despite Green Investments)",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly suggests that despite significant green investments, carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise, implying that climate policies (such as green investments) are not achieving their intended environmental goals."

      "evidence_quote": "Deutsche bank in particular drew some criticism from activist groups that considered the move to be insufficient, since it did not include similar cutbacks in oil and gas",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the scope of climate policies (e.g., insufficient action on oil and gas), but it does not fit neatly into the provided subnarrative definitions. It reflects a broader critique of the adequacy of climate policies without directly addressing ineffectiveness, economic impact, or profit motives."

      "evidence_quote": "Both banks are founding members of the United Nations’ Net Zero Banking Alliance, which requires its 126 members to set goals and disclose financial data related to their efforts to reduce the emissions of their lending portfolio to net zero by 2050.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies skepticism or criticism of the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance by framing it as an external entity influencing banks' policies, which aligns with the subnarrative of criticizing international entities' role in climate policy."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes a political figure (Brad Lander) for pressuring banks to adopt climate-related policies, which fits the subnarrative of discrediting political organizations and figures in the context of climate change debate."
    },

      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the U.S. Federal Reserve for imposing climate-related requirements on banks, which aligns with the subnarrative of disapproving of national governments' handling of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives, it supports the parent narrative by implying that banks' shift toward green energy investments is part of a broader, potentially misguided trend driven by institutional pressures."

      "reasoning": "The text implies that activist groups are pushing for extreme measures (e.g., cutting all oil and gas investments) without considering practical energy needs, suggesting an alarmist approach to climate action."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks... have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios... New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "The text suggests that activist investors and political figures are using financial leverage (e.g., threats to pull pension funds) to coerce banks into adopting climate policies, implying corruption or undue influence."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021... The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the disproportionate investment in green energy compared to fossil fuels, framing it as a potential overreach by the climate movement without explicitly fitting the other subnarrative definitions. This supports the parent narrative but does not align neatly with the provided subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that green energy policies are being imposed on developing nations without consideration for their economic or infrastructural limitations, reflecting a neo-colonial dynamic where developed nations dictate terms to less powerful countries."

      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks — all named above — submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by framing regulatory actions related to climate change as a form of geopolitical or institutional control, but it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism.' It suggests an overarching influence of green policies as tools of geopolitical strategy."

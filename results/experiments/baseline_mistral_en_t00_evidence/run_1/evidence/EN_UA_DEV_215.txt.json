      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines Ukraine's legitimacy by emphasizing its corruption, aligning with the definition of discrediting Ukraine as a nation and its governance."

      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill...",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the war's negative consequences (e.g., reduced Western support) are due to Ukraine's corruption rather than Russia's invasion, shifting blame away from Russia."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the reliability and integrity of Hersh's claims, indirectly casting doubt on media narratives and aligning with the definition of distrust towards media."

      "evidence_quote": "The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes U.S. government actions and policies, portraying them as ineffective or misguided, which aligns with the definition of discrediting the West."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly targets the Ukrainian government and its officials by portraying them as inherently corrupt, aligning with the subnarrative's definition of delegitimizing the government and its policies."

      "evidence_quote": "The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Ukraine is a center for fraud and illicit activities, particularly regarding the misuse of aid and weapons, which fits the subnarrative of portraying Ukraine as a hub for criminal activities."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by implying that Ukraine's corruption undermines its moral standing and Western support, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It focuses on the broader impact of corruption on public perception rather than a direct attack on Ukraine's government, military, or society."

      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts focus away from Russia's invasion by implying that the U.S. and NATO are the primary actors with self-serving motives, rather than acknowledging Russia as the aggressor. It frames the conflict as being driven by Western interests, aligning with the subnarrative of blaming the West for the war."

The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by suggesting that Western support for Ukraine is faltering due to corruption, indirectly implying that the war's continuation is tied to Western actions and failures rather than Russia's invasion. This does not fit the specific subnarratives but still aligns with the broader goal of shifting blame away from Russia."

      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The text discredits a prominent Western journalist by framing his reporting as 'Russian propaganda' and dismissing his claims as 'thinly sourced.' This aligns with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda, as it implies that Western journalists may be manipulated or biased in their coverage of the war."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This thinly sourced statement, however, skims over the complexities of a very nuanced war. It is not a statement that can exist without a deeper explanation–and that explanation takes the wind out of the sails of a very damaging allegation.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes Hersh's reporting for lacking depth and nuance, suggesting that his allegations are misleading or incomplete. While this does not fit a specific subnarrative directly, it supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by implying that media reports (even from reputable sources) may be unreliable or oversimplified."

      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly states that Western (specifically U.S.) support for Ukraine is not motivated by concern for Ukraine itself but rather by self-interested geopolitical calculations, aligning with the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "From this perspective, the shock and awe over the level of war-time corruption seems misplaced.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase suggests that Western reactions to corruption in Ukraine are exaggerated or disproportionate, fitting the subnarrative of the West overreacting to Russia’s actions or associated issues."

      "evidence_quote": "The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by implying that Western (U.S.) public and political support for Ukraine is waning due to corruption, which could undermine Western unity and resolve. However, it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly discusses the potential for Western support (including sanctions and aid) to weaken due to corruption scandals, implying that Western efforts could backfire by eroding public and political will to continue backing Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Does learning that this isn’t the Disney version of war and that the side the West is fighting for is simply the lesser corrupt among the two parties mean we should soften support for Ukraine’s war effort? Does learning that there may have been contract fraud along the chain from the U.S. to Ukraine mean we should withdraw and let Putin do as Putin will?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question supports the parent narrative by suggesting that Western support for Ukraine is fragile and could collapse due to disillusionment with corruption, which is a negative consequence for the West. However, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, hence the use of 'Other'."

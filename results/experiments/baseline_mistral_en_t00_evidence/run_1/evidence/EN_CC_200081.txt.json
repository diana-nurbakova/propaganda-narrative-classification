      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the effectiveness and environmental trade-offs of climate policies, specifically the felling of trees for wind farms, implying that the policy is counterproductive or misguided."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), Mairi Gougeon, has admitted that some 15.7 million trees were cut down since the year 2000...",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the competence and integrity of the Scottish government by framing its actions as environmentally harmful and politically motivated, using terms like 'leftist-separatist' to undermine its legitimacy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "The text expresses skepticism about wind turbines by highlighting their environmental and geopolitical drawbacks, such as reliance on rare earth minerals mined in China and associated health risks."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms... sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the motives and impact of the climate movement by portraying its policies as harmful to local communities, wildlife, and the environment, suggesting that the movement overlooks these consequences."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "Nevertheless, the Scottish government has vowed to continue its 'green energy' push, with a Forestry and Land Scotland spokesman saying: 'Renewable energy generated from wind farms is a key element in Scotland’s response to the climate emergency...'",
      "reasoning": "While not explicitly downplaying climate change, the text undermines the urgency of the 'climate emergency' by focusing on the negative consequences of wind farms, implying that the response may be disproportionate or flawed."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights multiple unintended negative environmental consequences of wind farms, suggesting that the policy of replacing trees with wind turbines does not achieve its intended environmental goals and may even exacerbate ecological harm."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "Mr Kerr said: ‘Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,’ adding that the government ‘must be alive’ to the ‘significant costs’ of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly references the 'significant costs' of wind turbine installation, implying that climate policies (e.g., wind farm development) lead to negative economic outcomes, such as financial burdens or reduced economic viability for rural communities."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies (wind farm development) for their broader negative impacts on rural communities, wildlife, and local businesses, which do not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives but still align with the overarching criticism of climate policies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the Scottish government's actions and policies regarding climate change initiatives, specifically the felling of trees for wind farms, which aligns with the definition of disapproving national governments' handling of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Nevertheless, the Scottish government has vowed to continue its 'green energy' push... Renewable energy generated from wind farms is a key element in Scotland’s response to the climate emergency and the shift towards net zero...",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided. It criticizes the Scottish government's broader commitment to 'green energy' without targeting a specific entity like the EU, international bodies, or political figures directly."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly highlights the dangers and negative consequences associated with wind turbines, including harm to wildlife and severe health impacts on local populations due to mining for rare earth minerals. This aligns with the definition of the subnarrative that renewable energy poses significant risks or dangers."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms... Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the environmental impact of wind farms (specifically deforestation), it does not neatly fit into the predefined subnarratives of 'dangerous,' 'unreliable,' or 'costly.' Thus, it qualifies for the 'Other' category as it contributes to controversy about green technologies without matching the specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people... children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This argument critiques the broader implications of the climate movement's push for renewable energy (e.g., human costs of rare earth mineral mining) but does not fit the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks. It supports the parent narrative by questioning the movement's overall efficacy and ethics."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Renewable energy generated from wind farms is a key element in Scotland’s response to the climate emergency and the shift towards net zero and the infrastructure on land that we manage generates enough power for 600,000 homes.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly deny climate change, it frames the Scottish government's 'green energy' push as misguided and harmful (e.g., cutting down trees, environmental damage, reliance on harmful mining practices). This indirectly downplays the urgency of climate action by portraying it as counterproductive or hypocritical, aligning with the parent narrative of downplaying climate change without fitting a specific subnarrative definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Human activities do not impact climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "the majority were expected to be cut down for commercial uses, regardless.",
      "reasoning": "This statement suggests that the trees would have been felled for commercial purposes anyway, implying that human activities like wind farm development are not uniquely harmful or impactful to the climate, thus downplaying the role of human activities in climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Humans and nature will adapt to the changes",
      "evidence_quote": "Where woodland is removed in association with development, developers will generally be expected to provide compensatory planting in order to avoid a net loss of woodland.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that nature can be easily 'replaced' or compensated for through replanting, suggesting that humans and nature will adapt to environmental changes without significant long-term consequences, which aligns with the subnarrative that humans and nature will adapt to climate changes."

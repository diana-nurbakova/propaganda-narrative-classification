      "reasoning": "This quote highlights criticism directed at the UK Prime Minister's decision-making and competence, suggesting that institutions and authorities (Sunak, the government) are being challenged by various groups, including within his own party."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Sunak has been sending mixed signals about his government’s energy and climate policies. The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the consistency and effectiveness of the UK government's climate policies, criticizing the reversal of decisions and the demotion of key climate figures, which implies a lack of commitment or clarity in climate policy."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the UK government's initial decision to skip the COP27 summit, highlighting disapproval from various groups, which aligns with the subnarrative of criticizing national governments' handling of climate change."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote discredits Sunak and his government's inconsistent climate policies and decisions, such as demoting key climate figures, which fits the subnarrative of criticizing political figures in the context of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Downing Street also confirmed that King Charles III, who last year told COP26 in Glasgow that the world have to be on a 'war-like footing' over climate change, will not attend the summit. The new monarch was advised not to go by former Prime Minister Liz Truss.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the decision-making process involving the monarchy and former political leadership regarding climate action, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the inconsistency and perceived downgrading of climate policy leadership within the government, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other specific subnarratives. It implies a lack of genuine commitment to climate action."

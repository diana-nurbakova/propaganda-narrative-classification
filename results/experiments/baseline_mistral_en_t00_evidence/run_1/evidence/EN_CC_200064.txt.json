      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the Swedish dance show... three climate change radicals stormed the stage... The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "The text portrays the climate activists as 'radicals' and 'eco-loons,' challenging their motives and integrity. It also highlights the negative consequences of their actions (being knocked down, arrested, and facing charges), which undermines the perceived legitimacy and impact of the climate movement."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote from the activist group explicitly emphasizes and amplifies fears about the consequences of climate change, framing it as an imminent and catastrophic threat to society. While it is a direct quote from the activists, the inclusion of this statement in the broader context of the article may serve to highlight the perceived alarmism of the climate movement."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that the climate movement is exaggerating the severity of climate change by framing it as an imminent 'societal collapse' with 'devastating consequences,' which aligns with the definition of the climate movement being alarmist."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the Swedish Dance Show... three climate change radicals stormed the stage... released yellow paint powder, and unfurled a large banner... The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "The text portrays the climate activists as disruptive, reckless, and even criminal (e.g., storming a stage, releasing paint, facing vandalism charges), which supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks. This qualifies as 'Other.'"

      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly presents a catastrophic scenario where climate change leads to societal collapse and devastating consequences, aligning with the definition of 'Doomsday scenarios for humans'."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase supports the parent narrative by framing climate activism as urgent and disruptive, implying that climate fears justify extreme actions. However, it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives, so it is classified under 'Other'."

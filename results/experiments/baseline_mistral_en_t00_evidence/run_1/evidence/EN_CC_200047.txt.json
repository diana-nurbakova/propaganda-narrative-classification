      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly 'fight climate change.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote questions the motives and economic impact of climate policies (e.g., rationing resources) by implying they are not genuinely aimed at addressing climate change, fitting the definition of criticism of climate policies."

      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly 'fight climate change.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that the WEF's climate policies are being used as a tool to exert control over the general public, rather than being driven by genuine environmental concern, which fits the narrative of green policies as geopolitical instruments."

      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called 'American elites' support the tyrannical 'climate' policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, by labeling its climate policies as 'tyrannical' and implying undue influence over 'American elites.'

      "reasoning": "The quote discredits 'America’s wealthiest citizens' (implied political or influential figures) by suggesting they support restrictive policies that harm the public, framing them as out of touch or malicious. This fits the subnarrative of criticizing political organizations and figures in the context of climate change debate."

      "evidence_quote": "The report is based on two surveys of 1,000 elites conducted last fall. 'The study also examined a sub-sample of elites, adults who attended Ivy League schools or other elite private schools, including Northwestern, Duke, Stanford, and the University of Chicago' according to CUP.",
      "reasoning": "While the text primarily criticizes the WEF and 'American elites,' this quote extends the criticism to academic institutions (Ivy League and elite private schools) as part of the 'elite' group that is out of touch with average Americans. This does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives but still supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities."

      "reasoning": "The quote implies that climate policies (rationing gas, electricity, and meat) will impose restrictions on the general public, which can be interpreted as having a negative economic impact by limiting access to essential resources and reducing quality of life."

      "evidence_quote": "The report includes polling data regarding support for policies designed to force compliance with the WEF’s 'Net Zero' agenda.",

      "evidence_quote": "nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the mindset of elites supporting climate policies by suggesting they are out of touch with the values of freedom and liberty, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit into the specific subnarratives provided."

      "reasoning": "The quote uses the term 'so-called' to dismiss the legitimacy of the 'climate crisis,' implying that the climate movement exaggerates the severity of climate change for dramatic effect, which aligns with the definition of the subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement's supporters by implying they are out of touch with the realities of freedom in America, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly 'fight climate change.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames the WEF's climate policies as a plan imposed by elites to ration essential resources for the general public, portraying these policies as abusive and exploitative in nature. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate-related international relations are economically or socially abusive."

      "evidence_quote": "The poll, released this month and titled 'Them vs. U.S.: The two Americas and how the nation’s elite is out of touch with average Americans,' was billed by the committee as a 'first-of-its-kind look at the views of the American Elite.' They are defined as 'people having at least one post-graduate degree, earning at least $150,000 annually, and living in high-population density areas (more than 10,000 people per square mile in their zip code).' The study also examined a sub-sample of elites, adults who attended Ivy League schools or other elite private schools...",
      "reasoning": "The text emphasizes a divide between a wealthy, highly educated elite (often associated with global institutions like the WEF) and the general public, suggesting that green policies are being imposed by a privileged class on the broader population. This framing implies a neo-colonial dynamic where elites exert control over the lives and resources of others, aligning with the subnarrative of green activities as neo-colonialism."

Nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying green policies as tools of control wielded by elites to restrict freedoms and enforce compliance, but it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'abusive/exploitative relations' or 'neo-colonialism.' It instead highlights the broader theme of green policies as instruments of geopolitical or social manipulation, warranting inclusion under 'Other.'"

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames the WEF and 'American elites' as engaging in a hidden, tyrannical plot to impose rationing policies on the general public under the guise of climate change. This aligns with the parent narrative of hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups, but does not fit a more specific subnarrative, thus falling under 'Other'."

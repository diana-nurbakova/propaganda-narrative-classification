      "evidence_quote": "However, the environmental excuse appears to be a smokescreen for the real desired outcome by the ECB, namely the formation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and the elimination of non-government-controlled alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the motives behind the climate-related justification for banning cryptocurrencies, suggesting that the policy is not genuinely about environmental concerns but rather about advancing other agendas (e.g., CBDCs). This aligns with the definition of criticizing the motives behind climate policies."

      "evidence_quote": "However, the environmental excuse appears to be a smokescreen for the real desired outcome by the ECB, namely the formation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and the elimination of non-government-controlled alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the integrity and intentions of the European Central Bank (ECB), implying that the institution is using climate change as a pretext to advance its own agenda (e.g., CBDCs). This fits the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum should be banned due to their 'excessive ecological footprint', a top European Central banker said this week.",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses skepticism about the framing of cryptocurrencies as environmentally harmful, which is a form of criticism or controversy surrounding green technologies or their perceived alternatives. The text later implies that the environmental concerns are exaggerated or misused, further supporting this narrative."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "However, the environmental excuse appears to be a smokescreen for the real desired outcome by the ECB, namely the formation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and the elimination of non-government-controlled alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the ECB is using climate change as a cover for a hidden agenda (e.g., promoting CBDCs and eliminating decentralized currencies), which aligns with the idea of a hidden plot by a powerful group (the ECB)."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "It would ensure that money continues to be denominated in euros. And It would be based on a European infrastructure, facilitating intermediaries to scale payments innovation throughout the euro area and thus strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the push for a digital euro (linked to climate policy justifications) is not solely about environmental concerns but also about strengthening Europe's geopolitical position and autonomy. This aligns with the narrative that green policies are used as geopolitical instruments."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "However, the environmental excuse appears to be a smokescreen for the real desired outcome by the ECB, namely the formation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and the elimination of non-government-controlled alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly argues that the climate-related justification for banning cryptocurrencies is not genuine but rather a pretext to advance the ECB's financial interests, specifically the promotion of a CBDC. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies are driven by financial or corporate gain rather than environmental concerns."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum should be banned due to their 'excessive ecological footprint'... those 'crypto-assets deemed to have an excessive ecological footprint should be banned.'",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies, it does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives. It frames the ban as a climate policy but does not explicitly claim ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motives. Thus, it qualifies as a remainder under the 'Other' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of the EU",
      "evidence_quote": "However, the environmental excuse appears to be a smokescreen for the real desired outcome by the ECB, namely the formation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and the elimination of non-government-controlled alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the European Central Bank (ECB), an EU institution, by suggesting that its stated environmental concerns are disingenuous and that its true motive is to eliminate competition to a centralized digital currency. This aligns with the definition of criticizing the EU's role or approach."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Fabio Panetta, who serves on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB), called for the European Union to ban cryptocurrencies... The Italian economist said that due to the European Union’s commitment to combatting climate change, those 'crypto-assets deemed to have an excessive ecological footprint should be banned.'",
      "reasoning": "The ECB is an international entity with significant influence over EU policy. The quote criticizes its role in pushing for a ban on cryptocurrencies under the pretext of climate change, which fits the subnarrative of criticizing international entities' influence on policy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, in the UK, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been a leading voice in supporting the implementation of a CBDC issued by the Bank of England... some fear that the CBDC would eventually replace cash outright.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the UK government's support for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), suggesting it may lead to the elimination of cash and implying a negative outcome. This aligns with the subnarrative of disapproving of how national governments handle financial and technological policies."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Tom Mutton of the Bank of England said: 'You could introduce programmability – what happens if one of the participants in a transaction puts a restriction on [future use of the money]? There could be some socially beneficial outcomes from that, preventing activity which is seen to be socially harmful in some way. But at the same time it could be a restriction on people’s freedoms.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes a political figure (Tom Mutton of the Bank of England) by highlighting the potential dangers of a CBDC, specifically the risk of government overreach and restrictions on personal freedoms. This fits the subnarrative of discrediting political figures in the context of policy debates."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The dangers of a Central Bank Digital Currency were laid out by the Bank of England itself, which admitted last year that they could be made 'programable' so that the government could decide how citizens are able to spend their own money.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the broader concept of central bank digital currencies and their implications for personal freedom. However, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided, as it critiques a general policy direction rather than a specific institution, entity, or figure. Thus, it qualifies for the 'Other' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum should be banned due to their 'excessive ecological footprint'... an energy-intensive but decentralised process that involves computers solving complex equations to compete for the ability to complete the transaction.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the energy use of cryptocurrencies as 'excessive' and implicitly suggests that the cost (both financial and environmental) of their energy consumption is too high, aligning with the subnarrative that renewable or alternative energy sources (or technologies relying on them) are too costly or inefficient."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "However, the environmental excuse appears to be a smokescreen for the real desired outcome by the ECB, namely the formation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and the elimination of non-government-controlled alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by casting doubt on the legitimacy of environmental concerns as a reason to oppose cryptocurrencies, implying ulterior motives. However, it does not fit any of the specific subnarratives about green technologies directly, so it is classified under 'Other'."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "However, the environmental excuse appears to be a smokescreen for the real desired outcome by the ECB, namely the formation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and the elimination of non-government-controlled alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly suggests that the ECB's public justification (climate change) is a cover for a hidden agenda (eliminating decentralized cryptocurrencies to promote a state-controlled CBDC). This aligns with the parent narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups, as it implies a deliberate deception by a powerful financial institution."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting a potential hidden scheme where governments could use CBDCs to control citizens' financial freedoms, implying a broader conspiracy by powerful institutions to exert control over individuals."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "However, the environmental excuse appears to be a smokescreen for the real desired outcome by the ECB, namely the formation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and the elimination of non-government-controlled alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly suggests that the climate change argument is being used as a pretext to advance geopolitical or economic control, framing the EU's climate-related policies as exploitative or manipulative in their intent to eliminate decentralized financial systems."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It would thus preserve the singleness of money and protect monetary sovereignty. The ECB is working on a digital euro precisely for these reasons.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by implying that green policies (e.g., banning Bitcoin for environmental reasons) are being leveraged to strengthen the EU's strategic autonomy and monetary control, which aligns with the broader idea of green policies as geopolitical tools but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "The quote implies that the war is being framed as a result of American support for Ukraine, shifting blame away from Russia's invasion and onto the U.S. and its allies."

Ultimately, after the narrative has circulated online for a series of days or weeks, U.S. audiences repeat and repost this disinformation, likely unaware of its original source.",
      "reasoning": "The quote undermines confidence in media sources by suggesting that disinformation is being spread through seemingly legitimate websites, implying that audiences cannot trust the origin or veracity of online content."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions Russian accounts criticizing American support for Ukraine, implying that the U.S. (part of the Western block) is responsible for prolonging or escalating the conflict, which aligns with the subnarrative of shifting blame to the West."

      "evidence_quote": "Messaging regarding Ukraine - via traditional media and social media - picked up steam over the last two months with a mix of covert and overt campaigns from at least 70 Russia-affiliated activity sets we track... Ultimately, after the narrative has circulated online for a series of days or weeks, U.S. audiences repeat and repost this disinformation, likely unaware of its original source.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly state a specific blame-shifting argument beyond the West, it describes a broader Russian campaign to disseminate narratives about Ukraine that likely include manipulative framing of the war. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, warranting the inclusion of 'Other'."

That content is then covered by a network of websites that include DC Weekly, Miami Chronical and The Intel Drop. 'Ultimately, after the narrative has circulated online for a series of days or weeks, U.S. audiences repeat and repost this disinformation, likely unaware of its original source,' Microsoft said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly describes a coordinated effort to disseminate disinformation through seemingly independent media outlets, implying that Western media (or media posing as Western) can be manipulated to spread false narratives. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda, as it suggests these outlets are being used to shape public opinion through deceptive means."

      "evidence_quote": "Microsoft said Wednesday Russian online campaigns to influence the upcoming U.S. presidential election kicked into gear over the past 45 days, but at a slower pace than in past elections. Russia-linked accounts are disseminating divisive content aimed at U.S. audiences, including criticizing American support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, researchers at the tech giant said in a report.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by highlighting Russian efforts to influence U.S. audiences through divisive content, it does not specifically target Western or Ukrainian media institutions. Instead, it broadly describes foreign interference in media narratives, which does not fit the predefined subnarratives but still contributes to the overarching theme of media distrust."

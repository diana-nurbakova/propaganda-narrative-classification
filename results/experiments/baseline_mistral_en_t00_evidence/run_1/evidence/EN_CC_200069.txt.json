    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the implementation of street zoning barriers, which are likely part of climate or traffic reduction policies, by framing them as an unjust imposition and celebrating their destruction. This directly questions the effectiveness and acceptability of such climate-related policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' implies a deliberate deception or manipulation by authorities and institutions regarding climate change, challenging their integrity and intentions. The text also frames resistance against these institutions as a justified and heroic act."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' disparages the climate movement by portraying it as irrational or extreme. The text also frames opposition to the movement as a rational and necessary response, further criticizing its motives and impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "THE GREAT CLIMATE CON",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'con' (short for 'conspiracy' or 'fraud') suggests that climate change is being exaggerated or fabricated, thereby minimizing its significance or impact. This framing downplays the urgency and legitimacy of climate change as a serious issue."
    }

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The destruction of street zoning barriers implies that residents view these climate-related measures as ineffective or counterproductive, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' frames climate policies as deceptive or fraudulent, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other subnarrative definitions. This phrase reinforces skepticism about the legitimacy of climate policies beyond just their effectiveness or economic impact."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers... Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the UK government's climate policies by framing them as 'climate change madness' and portraying resistance to these policies as a justified and heroic act. This directly disapproves of how the national government is handling climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Piers Corbyn and friends are taking to the streets on Friday the 13th of January.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of Piers Corbyn, a political figure associated with opposition to climate policies, alongside the framing of resistance as a fight against 'The Climate Con,' discredits political figures and organizations supporting climate action."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'The Climate Con' broadly criticizes institutions and authorities involved in climate policy without specifying a particular entity, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' suggests that the climate movement is exaggerating the severity of climate change, framing it as irrational or overly dramatic, which aligns with the definition of the subnarrative 'Climate movement is alarmist'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' implies that the climate movement is deceptive or fraudulent, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other specific subnarratives. This constitutes a remainder that warrants inclusion under 'Other'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "THE GREAT CLIMATE CON",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'THE GREAT CLIMATE CON' explicitly frames climate change as a deception or hoax, which supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but does not fit any of the specific subnarratives provided. It implies that climate change is not a real or serious issue, aligning with the broader goal of undermining climate action."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Climate cycles are natural",
      "evidence_quote": "resistance to the climate change madness in the UK",
      "reasoning": "The term 'climate change madness' suggests that climate change is an irrational or exaggerated concern, which can imply that it is not a real or significant issue. While not a direct statement about natural cycles, the dismissive tone aligns with the broader subnarrative that climate change is not a legitimate threat, potentially hinting at natural variability as an explanation."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Human activities do not impact climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "resistance to The Climate Con",
      "reasoning": "The repeated use of 'The Climate Con' implies that climate change is a fabricated or exaggerated issue, which indirectly supports the idea that human activities are not responsible for climate change. This aligns with the subnarrative that human influence on climate is negligible or non-existent."

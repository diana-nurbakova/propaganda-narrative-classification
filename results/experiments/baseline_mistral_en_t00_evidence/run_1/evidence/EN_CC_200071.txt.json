      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote expresses skepticism and criticism of wind, solar, and biomass energy, questioning their efficiency, environmental impact, and scalability, which fits the definition of 'Controversy about green technologies.'"

      "evidence_quote": "How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that green policies may weaken the U.S. geopolitically, suggesting they are not implemented for genuine environmental concern but rather as tools that could undermine national strength, fitting the definition of 'Green policies are geopolitical instruments.'"

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills. And these elevated prices for essentials factor into price increases for everything else.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that climate policies are causing financial hardship for average Americans, including making housing unaffordable, which aligns with the definition of climate policies having a negative economic impact."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that renewable energy sources promoted by climate policies are inefficient and unable to meet energy demands, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended environmental or energy goals."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that 'lower greenhouse gas emissions' and fight the so-called 'climate crisis.'... This additional spending for owners of houses and residential buildings comes at a period in the United States when families are already struggling to afford a home.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies, it focuses on the specific burden of compliance costs and government incentives, which does not neatly fit the predefined subnarratives but still criticizes climate policies."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation... The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills... forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes... compel homeowners to spend as much as $31,000 to renovate their homes to be in compliance with this directive.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly states that renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are 'more inefficient and expensive,' directly aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly. It further argues that green policies increase living expenses, such as housing and utility bills, reinforcing the claim that these technologies are financially burdensome for average Americans."

      "evidence_quote": "cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources are incapable of meeting the energy demands of the nation or the world, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is unreliable for widespread adoption."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations... 'Green energy' mining is polluting rivers and farmland at an unsustainable pace, leaving 23 million people exposed to toxic waste.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights environmental harm caused by renewable energy infrastructure, such as wind farms killing wildlife and mining polluting rivers and farmland. This supports the subnarrative that renewable energy is dangerous."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "development of renewable energy sources like hydroelectric and nuclear power plants is also being slowed down, if not completely stopped... John Kerry admits NUCLEAR ENERGY is necessary but continues to push for wind and solar instead.",
      "reasoning": "While the text criticizes the broader green agenda, these quotes specifically target the exclusion or slowing of nuclear and hydroelectric energy development, which does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives. This supports the parent narrative but does not align with the specific definitions, warranting the use of 'Other'."

Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that 'lower greenhouse gas emissions' and fight the so-called 'climate crisis.'",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly criticizes the Biden administration and its Department of Energy for implementing policies that are portrayed as harmful to the affordability of housing for average Americans. This directly disapproves of how the national government is handling climate change policies."

The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills.",
      "reasoning": "While the text heavily criticizes climate policies and their impact on affordability, this specific quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities but does not neatly fit into the provided subnarratives. It broadly attacks the rationale and consequences of climate policies without specifying a particular institution or figure beyond the earlier mentions of Biden."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that 'lower greenhouse gas emissions' and fight the so-called 'climate crisis.' More than half of this endowment will go to implementing a universal 'energy conservation code' that will compel homeowners to spend as much as $31,000 to renovate their homes to be in compliance with this directive.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes the financial burden imposed on homeowners by green policies, framing them as economically abusive and coercive. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate-related international relations (or domestic policies framed as part of a global agenda) are exploitative."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "'To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted,' wrote Ring for American Greatness, while at the same time pointing out that the development of renewable energy sources like hydroelectric and nuclear power plants is also being slowed down, if not completely stopped. Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation... 'The consequences of \"green\" policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,' wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text supports the parent narrative by arguing that green policies are part of a broader agenda that harms Americans economically and strategically (e.g., weakening the nation's ability to withstand military conflict). However, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'abusive/exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism,' thus qualifying for 'Other.'"

      "evidence_quote": "\"To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames the climate movement's goals as an 'alleged' crisis, suggesting exaggeration or dramatization of the severity of climate change, which aligns with the definition of the subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "These quotes criticize the economic and practical impacts of climate policies (e.g., housing unaffordability, forced compliance with green building codes) but do not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. They support the parent narrative by attacking the climate movement's policies without directly alleging corruption, alarmism, or ad hominem attacks."

      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the US as having a primary, materialistic motive for the conflict (access to minerals), which implicitly shifts the blame for the war's continuation away from Russia's invasion and onto Western economic interests."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Graham is treating Ukraine as a future colony of the US with his comments on the ownership of the country's natural resources... 'The fate of the colonies is always the same: the Americans will scoop up all the natural resources of Ukraine in exchange for 'the great honor of being a friend of the United States''",
      "reasoning": "The text, through the Russian official's statement, directly criticizes and discredits Western (specifically US) intentions, portraying them as colonialist and exploitative rather than supportive of Ukrainian sovereignty."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the legitimacy of the Ukrainian government by labeling it as both 'corrupt' and a 'neo-Nazi regime', which is a common narrative used to undermine Ukraine's leadership and justify aggression against it."

      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the US/West's motivation for involvement in the war as securing access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, shifting the cause of the conflict from Russian aggression to Western economic greed."

      "reasoning": "This statement, attributed to a Russian official, explicitly characterizes the West (specifically the US) as a colonial aggressor exploiting the conflict for resource extraction, blaming the West for the war's continuation."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase supports the parent narrative by blaming the war on a corrupt Ukrainian leadership ('neo-Nazi regime in Kiev') that is allegedly propped up by the West, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific 'West as aggressor' or 'Ukraine as aggressor' subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Washington 'cannot afford' to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the West's (specifically the US's) motivation for supporting Ukraine as purely self-interested economic gain, centered on accessing Ukraine's mineral wealth, rather than caring about Ukraine's sovereignty or fate."

      "reasoning": "This statement, and the subsequent colonial framing, supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying it as predatory and imperialistic. This specific argument—that the West seeks to turn Ukraine into a colony—does not fit neatly into any of the other provided subnarrative definitions (e.g., division, weakness, overreaction, diplomatic failure, or fatigue)."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Graham is treating Ukraine as a future colony of the US with his comments on the ownership of the country's natural resources\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames Ukraine as a future colony of the United States, portraying it not as an independent nation but as a territory to be exploited and controlled by Western powers, specifically the US."

      "reasoning": "The phrase 'neo-Nazi regime in Kiev' explicitly associates the Ukrainian government with Nazi ideology, which is a core element of this subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Washington 'cannot afford' to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by framing the entire Western involvement in the conflict as a cynical, resource-grabbing economic venture rather than a defense of Ukrainian sovereignty or values. It reduces Ukraine's significance to its mineral wealth, which is a discrediting tactic not explicitly covered by the other specific subnarratives."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly attacks the character and legitimacy of the Ukrainian state by asserting widespread, pre-existing corruption as a universally accepted fact, undermining its moral standing."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western (specifically U.S.) policy and aid efforts by framing them as enabling massive fraud and irresponsible distribution of weapons, suggesting incompetence or negative consequences of Western actions."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill...",
      "reasoning": "This statement predicts a negative outcome for Western support, specifically that revelations of corruption will erode American public willingness to fund Ukraine's defense, which is an adverse consequence for Western policy objectives."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly delegitimizes the Ukrainian government and its policies by asserting that corruption is a deep-seated, pre-existing condition, framing the state as inherently corrupt and suggesting aid is being stolen."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities",
      "evidence_quote": "He cites an American intelligence source as saying that Ukraine is buying discounted Russian diesel to fuel its war and, as such, lining Putin’s pockets and also skimming from U.S. dollars intended to fund fuel purchases.",
      "reasoning": "This allegation frames Ukraine's wartime procurement as a criminal activity involving fraud (skimming U.S. funds) and indirectly funding the enemy, portraying the country as a center for illicit financial dealings."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by arguing that revelations of corruption are undermining international (specifically American) support and the reputation of its leadership, which is a discrediting effect not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western (specifically American) support for Ukraine is driven by self-interest (protecting Europe/NATO from Russia) rather than genuine concern for Ukraine's people or sovereignty, fitting the definition of the subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote claims that revelations of corruption are causing the American public to become less willing to support Ukraine financially and politically, indicating growing fatigue or disinterest, which aligns with the 'West is tired of Ukraine' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "Bulgaria’s only gas oil refinery is owned by Russian Lukoil, and Bulgaria is fully entitled to continue to operate this refinery with Russian oil because it has an exemption from EU sanctions. So, yes, essentially, Ukraine was buying “discounted Russian diesel”, but in a very indirect way and not in the brazen way described by Hersh’s unnamed intelligence source. All of this market activity is accepted by the EU.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a consequence of Western sanctions: an EU member state (Bulgaria) has an exemption allowing it to process Russian oil, and the resulting fuel is sold to Ukraine, indirectly funding Russia. This illustrates how sanctions regimes can be circumvented or have unintended effects that benefit the sanctioned party."

The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly argues that revelations of corruption in Ukraine (aided by Western funds) will lead to a negative consequence for the West: reduced public support and willingness to finance the defense effort against Russia, thereby weakening the Western position."

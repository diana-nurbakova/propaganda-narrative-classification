      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the West, through its media, is deliberately prolonging the war in Ukraine for its own reasons (e.g., to weaken Russia), disregarding the resulting death and suffering in Ukraine, which fits the subnarrative of the West being self-interested and not caring about Ukraine's fate."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West by portraying Americans/Westerners as morally bankrupt, hypocritical, and genocidal, but it does not fit neatly into any of the more specific diplomatic subnarratives provided.

      "reasoning": "This text supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by posing rhetorical questions that suggest desperation and the potential for escalation, but it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives (e.g., it doesn't explicitly warn of WW3, attack on other countries, or NATO intervention)."

      "reasoning": "This quote argues that Western (specifically American) demonization and overreaction to Russia is a long-standing, disproportionate policy. It implies that this aggressive posture, which includes sanctions and confrontation, is based on a false premise ('seldom a threat'), suggesting the Western strategy is misguided and will lead to negative, self-inflicted consequences."

      "reasoning": "This quote expresses a nihilistic desire for nuclear war as a release from the conflict, explicitly blaming 'un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries”' for creating a dire situation. It catastrophizes the outcome of Western policies, suggesting they are leading to total annihilation, which is a negative consequence for the West that does not fit the 'sanctions backfire' or 'refugee flows' definitions."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly attributes the 2015 crisis to both Russia's invasion and the policies of a former Ukrainian president, partially shifting blame for Ukraine's financial troubles onto a Ukrainian leader rather than solely on the invader, Russia."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This statement excessively lauds the 'free world' (a term often synonymous with the West) by framing its support as a moral crusade against tyranny, attributing a decisive, virtuous role to Western nations in the conflict."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear by speculating about direct, catastrophic attacks on civilian infrastructure in major Western European capitals, suggesting the war will inevitably spread to the West if Ukraine is not supported."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The statement predicts severe negative consequences (destruction of hospitals) for Western nations, implying that failure to support Ukraine financially will lead to direct physical harm within Western countries."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the conflict as one where the 'civilized world' (the West) is actively taking aggressive financial actions (sanctions, asset confiscation) against Russia, portraying the West as a combatant party rather than Russia being the sole aggressor. It shifts the narrative of responsibility towards Western actions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This statement attributes part of the cause for Ukraine's 2015 financial crisis not only to Russia's invasion but also to the 'poor policies' of a former Ukrainian president. This fits the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by introducing a domestic Ukrainian political figure as a contributing factor to the nation's vulnerability, which is a form of shifting responsibility beyond the invader alone."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames the conflict as a moral battle between the 'free world' (the West) and 'dictators and tyrants', portraying Western support for Ukraine as an act aligned with justice and moral superiority."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support",
      "evidence_quote": "The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine...",
      "reasoning": "This statement emphasizes the 'unity of the free world' and its 'unwavering' support for Ukraine, presenting a picture of widespread and solid backing from Western nations and their allies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This passage overpraises the West by portraying it as the 'civilized world' that Ukraine is protecting, and frames Western cities (Amsterdam, Warsaw, Berlin, Prague) as the ultimate beneficiaries of Ukrainian victory, implying their inherent value and civilization that must be defended."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly warns that if Ukraine does not prevail, the Russian military threat will extend to other European countries, specifically naming cities in NATO member states, which matches the definition of evoking fear of imminent attack on other countries."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: The conflict will increase the Ukrainian refugee flows to Europe",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote catastrophizes the potential for the conflict to escalate and directly threaten Western European cities, implying severe negative consequences (destruction and civilian casualties) for the West if Ukraine is not financially supported to prevail."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Democracy and a just world order are the pillars of global economic sustainability, ensuring investment safety and security and investor profits worldwide.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that failure to support Ukraine (through debt restructuring) jeopardizes the global economic order and investor profits in the West, which is a negative consequence for the West not covered by the more specific subnarratives."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the effectiveness and environmental impact of a specific climate policy (wind farm development), framing it as contradictory ('green energy' in quotes) and destructive, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This quote lists multiple negative consequences (deforestation, wildlife harm, reliance on problematic mining) associated with wind turbines, expressing clear skepticism and criticism of this green technology."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "By highlighting dependency on a geopolitical adversary ('Communist China') for materials essential to green technology, the text frames the policy as creating or reinforcing geopolitical vulnerabilities, suggesting the policy serves or enables foreign power interests."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP)...",
      "reasoning": "The use of politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') to describe the governing authority challenges its legitimacy and intentions, which fits the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities in the context of climate action."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses 'supposedly' to cast doubt on the environmental benefit of the wind farms, implying the policy (promoting wind energy) is counterproductive by destroying trees, thus failing to achieve genuine environmental goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "“I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'damage to... business' as a concern raised by communities, directly linking the wind farm developments (a climate policy) to negative economic impacts."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes climate policies (wind energy) by highlighting severe negative social and environmental externalities (human suffering, pollution) linked to the supply chain, which is a form of criticism not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links wind turbine production to severe health and environmental dangers from mining rare earth minerals, framing renewable energy as causing significant harm."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "However, responding to the letter, Mr Kerr said: “Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,” adding that the government “must be alive” to the “significant costs” of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions the 'significant costs' of wind turbine installation, framing the development as having a high, perhaps unacceptable, price, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive or inefficient."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the pursuit of green energy (wind farms) as contradictory and hypocritical due to the massive deforestation required, supporting the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies but not fitting neatly into the specific 'dangerous', 'unreliable', 'costly', or 'nuclear' subnarratives. It introduces an argument about environmental trade-offs and hypocrisy."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the green energy supply chain as exploitative, where the environmental and health costs of mining rare earth minerals for Western wind turbines are borne by a developing nation (China), suggesting a modern form of colonial resource extraction and harm."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a national green policy (wind farm development) as hypocritical and destructive, framing it as an instrument that causes significant environmental damage (deforestation) under the guise of environmentalism, which supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical/instrumental but does not fit the specific 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the actions and policies of the Scottish national government, specifically its handling of environmental and energy development, which fits the definition of disapproving of how national governments handle climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The Rural Affairs Secretary for the leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), Mairi Gougeon, has admitted that some 15.7 million trees were cut down...",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') and singles out a specific political party (SNP) and its figure (Mairi Gougeon) to discredit their role in the climate/energy policy debate."

      "evidence_quote": "I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business. Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the authorities (the Scottish government) by highlighting public distrust and negative consequences of their policies, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing institutions. However, the specific criticism—focusing on local community impact, wildlife, and business damage—does not neatly fit the more specific definitions targeting the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures alone, as it is a broader critique of institutional decision-making and its effects."

      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policies (specifically rationing plans) as tyrannical and questions their true motive by using the word 'allegedly,' which directly criticizes the effectiveness and intentions behind these policies."

      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the integrity and intentions of both the 'American elites' and the WEF by describing their policies as 'tyrannical' and placing 'climate' in scare quotes, implying dishonesty or ulterior motives."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The “Committee to Unleash Prosperity [CUP], in a survey that sought to measure the beliefs of ‘elites,’ stated the findings reveal climate change ‘is clearly an obsession of the very rich and highly educated.’”",
      "reasoning": "This statement challenges the motives and perspective of the climate movement by framing concern for climate change as an 'obsession' of a detached elite class, thereby criticizing the movement's drivers and legitimacy."

      "reasoning": "The text presents a narrative of a powerful group (the WEF, supported by wealthy elites) orchestrating a secretive plan (rationing essential goods) under the pretext of climate action, fitting the definition of a hidden plot by powerful groups."

      "reasoning": "The phrase 'force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda' suggests that these environmental policies are tools used by a powerful international organization (the WEF) to exert control and influence, aligning with the narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments."

      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF)... in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The use of scare quotes around 'climate' and the term 'allegedly' directly casts doubt on the stated purpose of the policies, implying they are not genuinely effective at addressing climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "According to a report from the Committee to Unleash Prosperity (CUP)... America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public...",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the policies (rationing of essential goods like gas, electricity, and food) as direct restrictions that would lower the public's standard of living and quality of life, which is a core economic impact argument."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The report includes polling data regarding support for policies designed to force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'force compliance' and the association with the WEF's agenda suggests the policies are a top-down imposition by a powerful, non-democratic entity, aligning with the narrative that such agendas are driven by the interests of a global elite rather than public good."

      "evidence_quote": "Astonishingly, the polling shows that almost 90 percent of “American elites” believe strict rationing of gas, meat, and electricity is necessary to combat the so-called “climate crisis.”... 89 percent of those wealthy individuals from “top universities” believe in restrictions on the public’s quality of life to meet “Net Zero.”",
      "reasoning": "This evidence supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies as being supported by a detached, tyrannical elite who want to impose harsh lifestyle restrictions on the general public. This theme of elite vs. public conflict and the characterization of policies as 'tyrannical' and restricting liberty is a distinct criticism not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."

    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the attitudes of elites regarding liberty and governance, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities. However, it does not specifically target the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures as defined in the other subnarratives, making it a distinct remainder."

      "reasoning": "The text links the climate movement's policies to a powerful, elite group (the WEF and 'American elites'), describing them as 'tyrannical,' which implies the movement is driven by corrupt, self-serving motives rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, in another example of the pseudo-elite vs. street divide, 63 percent of Americans in general oppose the above rationing policy.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement by portraying it as an out-of-touch project of a 'pseudo-elite' that is opposed by the general public, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.'"

      "reasoning": "The use of 'allegedly' casts doubt on the stated motive of fighting climate change, implying the rationing plan serves a different, unstated purpose, which aligns with the subnarrative of claiming the climate agenda has hidden motives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the WEF's climate agenda as a plan for the wealthy elite to impose restrictive policies (rationing) on the general public, characterizing the international climate policy framework as an instrument for top-down control and exploitation of the populace's quality of life."

      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by depicting international climate policies (specifically those of the WEF) as 'tyrannical' instruments wielded by a detached elite class, but it does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives. It introduces a theme of elite-driven tyranny, which is a distinct argument within the broader idea that green policies are geopolitical instruments."

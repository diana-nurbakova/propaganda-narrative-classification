      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "By depriving rural residents of their right to just say no to green energy scams, the state-level \"greenies\" who control California, Illinois, Michigan and New York are pandering to corporate interests while lining their own pockets, all at the expense of their constituents.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the motives and implementation of state-level green energy policies, framing them as 'scams' that serve corporate and political interests while harming local communities, which aligns with the definition of questioning the effectiveness and motives behind climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Each of these so-called \"blue\" states ... is controlled by far-left politicians who are in bed with the green energy industry. Local governments in these four left-leaning states no longer have authority over their own land when it comes to the green projects being pushed by state-level bureaucrats, many of whom have sold their souls to \"renewable\" energy projects...",
      "reasoning": "This statement challenges the integrity and intentions of state politicians and bureaucrats, accusing them of being corruptly aligned with industry and depriving local governments of authority, fitting the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities in relation to climate change."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Green energy is a scam that benefits communist China and other foreign interests at the expense of American energy independence.",
      "reasoning": "This claim presents green energy policies not as genuine environmental efforts but as tools that serve foreign geopolitical interests (specifically China) and undermine national sovereignty, which matches the definition of green policies being used as geopolitical instruments."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "\"There is a reason we have eminent domain for some purposes, such as building pipelines and streets. Now, we have an abuse of eminent domain, and also an overriding of zoning – the problem is when you use it for something that relies on hype, without a proven and compelling public interest.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote, attributed to a cited expert, expresses skepticism about the necessity and public benefit of green energy projects, suggesting they are based on 'hype' rather than proven need, which aligns with the narrative of controversy and criticism surrounding green technologies."

      "evidence_quote": "By depriving rural residents of their right to just say no to green energy scams, the state-level 'greenies' who control California, Illinois, Michigan and New York are pandering to corporate interests while lining their own pockets, all at the expense of their constituents.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that climate policies (green energy projects) are driven by corporate interests and personal financial gain ('lining their own pockets'), which aligns with the definition that such policies are driven by profit rather than genuine environmental concerns."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "All that taxpayer cash being pumped into the green economy, supposedly to fight not just inflation but also climate change, is being used to drive family farmers off their land so it can be turned into another wind or solar farm, or perhaps the next carbon capture pipeline.",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that climate policy funding (the Inflation Reduction Act) is causing direct economic harm by displacing family farmers from their land, which is a negative economic outcome for individuals and local communities."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Green energy is a scam that benefits communist China and other foreign interests at the expense of American energy independence.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes climate policies (green energy) by framing them as a national security threat that benefits foreign adversaries and undermines American sovereignty. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the definitions of being ineffective, economically harmful, or profit-driven in the specific ways outlined in the other subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Many states where rural farmers now face assault by the green industry are taking advantage of the Biden regime's Inflation Reduction Act, which exists to help multinational corporations at the expense of mom-and-pop America.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the national government (the 'Biden regime') for enacting a policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) that is portrayed as harming American citizens to benefit corporations, fitting the definition of disapproval of how a national government handles climate-related policy."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Each of these so-called 'blue' states ... is controlled by far-left politicians who are in bed with the green energy industry.",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits specific political figures ('far-left politicians') by accusing them of corruption and collusion with industry, which aligns with the definition of criticizing political organizations and figures in the climate change debate."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Local governments in these four left-leaning states no longer have authority over their own land when it comes to the green projects being pushed by state-level bureaucrats, many of whom have sold their souls to 'renewable' energy projects...",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes state-level bureaucratic institutions and authorities (e.g., 'state-level bureaucrats', the Michigan Public Services Commission, ORES) for overriding local governance and being corrupt. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives targeting national governments, the EU, international entities, or political figures exclusively, as it targets a broader layer of governmental and administrative authority."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "Green energy is a scam that benefits communist China and other foreign interests at the expense of American energy independence.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames green energy policies as an instrument that benefits foreign powers (specifically China) to the detriment of the United States, characterizing the international dynamic as exploitative and abusive to American interests."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All that taxpayer cash being pumped into the green economy, supposedly to fight not just inflation but also climate change, is being used to drive family farmers off their land so it can be turned into another wind or solar farm, or perhaps the next carbon capture pipeline.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by depicting green policies as a coercive, top-down instrument used by state and federal governments to override local autonomy and dispossess citizens for corporate gain, which is a distinct argument about domestic power dynamics not covered by the specific 'neo-colonialism' or 'abusive international relations' subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "\"What we are seeing, for example, with the 'Inflation Reduction Act,' is one of the biggest gifts of money to corporations that we have ever seen in this country.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames renewable energy policy as a massive, wasteful corporate subsidy, aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive and a poor use of resources."

      "reasoning": "These quotes support the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies by arguing they are imposed undemocratically, involve corruption, and exploit local communities. This theme of political coercion and corporate capture is distinct from the specific subnarratives about danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy."

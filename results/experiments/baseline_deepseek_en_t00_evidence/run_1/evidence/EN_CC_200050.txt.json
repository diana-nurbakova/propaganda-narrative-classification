      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, implying that climate policies mandating such a shift are impractical and could harm energy security and developing nations."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline frames the banks' decisions as a submission to activist pressure ('Bend The Knee'), suggesting environmental policies are being used as tools to enforce a specific agenda rather than being driven by genuine environmental or economic considerations."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the climate movement's actions as coercive pressure ('faced pressure', 'activist investors') on financial institutions, challenging the movement's methods and impact on business decisions."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks — all named above — submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of the Federal Reserve mandating climate-related data submission frames a regulatory authority as overreaching and imposing climate-focused requirements on the banking sector, which can be interpreted as a challenge to its role and intentions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF. The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the banks' climate-related actions primarily as financial investment decisions, suggesting a shift in capital allocation driven by market trends and potential profit, rather than purely environmental motives. The numerical comparison of investment ratios implies a financial calculus behind the 'green' moves."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "(RELATED: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Shatter Record Despite Green Investments)",
      "reasoning": "This parenthetical note, presented as a related fact, directly contrasts green investments with a record-breaking increase in emissions, implying that the policies and investments being discussed are failing to achieve their core environmental goal of reducing emissions."

      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline frames the banks' policy changes as an act of submission ('Bend The Knee') to 'Climate Activists,' portraying climate-driven financial decisions as coerced or ideologically driven rather than rational or voluntary. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the global push for green energy as potentially exploitative, highlighting how developing nations lack the resources and infrastructure to comply with the rapid shift demanded by international climate alliances, thereby positioning these policies as economically abusive to those nations."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The statement implies that the green transition, driven by international alliances like the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance, imposes a framework on developing nations that they are ill-equipped to adopt, suggesting a form of external control and influence reminiscent of colonial practices, where developed nations dictate the economic and energy policies of less developed ones."

      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios... New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This describes green policies being used as a coercive financial and political instrument within domestic and international finance, leveraging shareholder activism and public pension funds to enforce compliance, which supports the parent narrative of green policies as geopolitical instruments but does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote, by highlighting the financial investment ratio, frames the climate movement's influence on banks as driven by financial interests and market pressures rather than purely environmental concerns, suggesting ulterior motives or a corrupting influence of capital."

      "reasoning": "The headline uses the phrase 'Bend The Knee,' which frames the banks' actions as a submissive surrender to activist pressure, criticizing the climate movement's tactics and influence as coercive or overbearing, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.'"

      "evidence_quote": "Both banks are founding members of the United Nations’ Net Zero Banking Alliance, which requires its 126 members to set goals and disclose financial data related to their efforts to reduce the emissions of their lending portfolio to net zero by 2050.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance as an entity imposing requirements on banks, implicitly criticizing its role in dictating financial and climate policy to major institutions."

      "evidence_quote": "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes a political figure (Comptroller Brad Lander) for using the threat of withdrawing public funds to pressure banks into adopting specific climate-related investment policies, portraying it as coercive activism."

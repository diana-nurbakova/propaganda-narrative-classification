      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage during Sweden’s Strictly Come Dancing final over the weekend.",
      "reasoning": "The terms 'radical climate activist' and the description of the activist being physically knocked down frames the climate movement's actions as extreme, disruptive, and deserving of physical rebuke, which challenges the integrity and methods of the movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "three climate change radicals stormed the stage.",
      "reasoning": "Labeling the activists as 'radicals' who 'stormed the stage' portrays the climate movement as aggressive and extremist, criticizing its tactics and public impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, attributed to the activist group, explicitly emphasizes catastrophic and devastating consequences of climate change, which aligns with the narrative of amplifying fears about climate impacts."

      "evidence_quote": "Watch: Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane After Storming Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The headline uses the derogatory term 'Eco-Loon' to attack the character and sanity of the activists, which is a direct ad hominem attack on key figures in the climate movement."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the activists' protest as a criminal act of vandalism, criticizing the movement's methods and supporting the parent narrative, but it does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or a direct ad hominem attack on a key figure."

      "evidence_quote": "Watch: Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane After Storming Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The term 'Eco-Loon' is a derogatory and dismissive label attacking the character and sanity of the activists, fitting the definition of ad hominem attacks on key activists."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames the activists' protest as a criminal act of vandalism, which criticizes the movement's methods and supports the parent narrative, but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or a direct ad hominem attack on a named key figure."

      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly presents a catastrophic, large-scale scenario (societal collapse) as a result of climate change, which aligns with the definition of presenting intense catastrophic scenarios for humans."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The statement uses the activists' disruptive action and their justification to amplify general climate fears. It supports the parent narrative by framing extreme protest as a necessary response to a dire threat, but the specific argument (justifying disruption due to a perceived existential threat) is not captured by the other, more specific subnarrative definitions."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes the escalation towards war to the US and NATO, framing their actions as the primary cause, thereby shifting blame away from Russia's own military actions and intentions regarding Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes and undermines the credibility of major Western media outlets and, by extension, Western information campaigns, accusing them of spreading lies to manipulate public opinion."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly questions the reliability and integrity of Western media, labeling it as 'filthy pro-imperialist' and framing it as the source of war talk, which aligns with the narrative of fostering distrust towards media sources."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war",
      "reasoning": "This headline statement, echoed throughout the text, evokes fear by asserting that the actions of the US and NATO are directly leading to a major war, amplifying anxieties about conflict escalation."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?... Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.",
      "reasoning": "These statements portray Russia as being justifiably concerned and threatened by NATO's eastward expansion and military posture, framing Russia's position as a defensive reaction to external pressure, thus casting Russia in a victimized light."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that Ukraine (its special forces) is planning a 'false-flag' operation, which is an accusation that undermines the legitimacy and intentions of Ukrainian actions, fitting the narrative of discrediting Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism... The entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt... The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.",
      "reasoning": "These passages highlight and predict severe domestic economic, political, and social crises within the United States, framing its aggressive foreign policy as a product of internal decay and implying negative consequences stemming from its actions."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts the responsibility for the conflict and its escalation to the United States and its European allies, portraying them as the deliberate instigators seeking war, which aligns with the definition of blaming the West as the aggressors."

      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by suggesting that Ukraine, with US backing, is planning a false-flag operation to justify conflict. It shifts blame from Russia but does not fit neatly into the 'Ukraine is the aggressor' subnarrative as it frames Ukraine as a proxy rather than the sole aggressor, and it is not solely about the West. It is a distinct argument supporting the overarching blame-shifting narrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented...",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly accuses Western governments and media of generating alarmist claims about a Russian invasion without evidence, framing the Western reaction as disproportionate and based on lies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames Western actions as using Ukraine merely as a tool or 'pretext' for their own geopolitical confrontation with Russia, implying their primary concern is not Ukraine's fate but their own strategic interests."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted. It writes: 'With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.'",
      "reasoning": "The text cites and endorses the view that the diplomatic window is closing or was never open, presenting diplomacy as a futile or exhausted option, which aligns with discrediting diplomatic efforts."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western motives, suggesting the push for conflict is a cynical domestic diversion. It does not fit neatly into any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, lack of care for Ukraine, diplomatic failure, or fatigue)."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses major Western media institutions (NYT, WaPo) of being part of a deliberate disinformation campaign, presenting lies as fact to manipulate public opinion, which aligns with the definition of Western media as an instrument of propaganda."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly discredits media on both sides of the Atlantic as 'filthy pro-imperialist,' supporting the parent narrative of distrust towards media. It does not exclusively target Ukrainian media, nor does it solely fit the specific definition of 'Western media is an instrument of propaganda' as it includes a more general, vitriolic condemnation of media as a whole entity aligned with imperialism."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that NATO should take a more direct and aggressive military action (delivering lethal weapons) in the conflict, which aligns with the subnarrative definition of suggesting NATO ought to or will take direct military action."

      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by accusing the US and NATO of deliberately seeking war, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about WW3, attacking other countries, nuclear weapons, or direct NATO intervention. It is a general amplification of the fear of intentional escalation leading to war."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the negative narrative about Russia's intentions as originating from a biased and hostile Western establishment and media, implying the reaction is driven by anti-Russian sentiment rather than facts."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence",
      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This quote justifies Russia's posture and potential actions as a necessary and defensive response to NATO's eastward expansion and the threat of Ukraine joining the alliance, framing it as a reaction to external aggression."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests Ukraine, with US backing, is preparing a false-flag operation, portraying Ukrainian forces as extremist or hostile actors actively conspiring against Russia, which aligns with the narrative of Ukraine being comprised of anti-Russian elements."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as a victim of Western/NATO ultimatums that infringe on its sovereignty, a theme not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives about self-defence, russophobia, or Ukrainian extremists."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that the Ukrainian government was installed by Western powers, portraying it as a creation and instrument of the US and Germany, which aligns with the subnarrative that Ukraine is controlled by the West."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that US military interventions (a form of escalation and confrontation) have backfired, leading to disastrous outcomes contrary to US intentions, which aligns with the idea that Western actions will have negative, self-defeating consequences."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western (specifically US) escalation is driven by a domestic crisis and implies that this reckless policy will not solve but rather compound its internal problems, representing a negative consequence distinct from sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

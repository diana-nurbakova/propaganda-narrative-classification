    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism. Run your eye down the contributors to The Climate Book and you can see who she’s been reading: Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Naomi Klein. For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames Greta Thunberg and her associated thinkers as having a hidden, radical political agenda (anti-capitalism) that subverts the stated goal of climate action, thereby challenging the motives and integrity of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This direct quote from the text dismisses a major international climate policy forum (COP) as ineffective and deceitful, questioning its motives and true impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly claims that climate policies are not genuine environmental efforts but are instead a tool ('dressed up' format) for advancing a specific, radical political ideology, aligning with the narrative that green policies are instruments for other goals."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2019, Stuart Basden revealed the true goals of the far-left environmentalist action group in a lengthy article posted on Medium... So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "The text presents a narrative that the climate movement, through figures like Basden and by extension Thunberg, is engaged in a covert plot with a 'true goal' of destroying Western civilization and imposing a radical political system, which fits the theme of hidden schemes by powerful groups."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses the metaphor of an 'alarm bell' and 'Cassandra' to frame Greta Thunberg's activism as inherently alarmist and focused on exaggerated warnings."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'demented manifesto' is a direct personal attack on Greta Thunberg, questioning her mental state and the validity of her political message."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by alleging its true goal is not environmental protection but the advancement of a radical leftist political ideology, which is a distinct criticism not covered by the more specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly characterizes a major international climate policy framework (COP) as a deceptive scheme for financial or reputational gain ('greenwashing'), aligning with the definition that climate policies are driven by profit rather than genuine environmental goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by arguing they are a covert vehicle for a radical political ideology, which is a distinct criticism not captured by the specific subnarratives about ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Normal” was the “system” which gave us the climate crisis, a system of “colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide”, of “racist, oppressive extractionism”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the climate crisis and the system behind it as being built on colonialism and imperialism, suggesting that green activism is a response to and a critique of a modern form of colonial exploitation."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This concluding statement explicitly argues that the climate movement is a geopolitical instrument aimed at destroying Western civilization and its values, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the more specific definitions of exploitative relations or neo-colonialism."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly claims that the stated goal of the climate agenda (addressing climate change) is a facade for a different, underlying political motive (radical leftism)."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups by alleging that the climate movement is a cover for a secret, broader agenda to destroy Western civilization and impose a specific political system. This argument does not neatly fit the 'Blaming global elites' or 'Climate agenda has hidden motives' definitions, as it focuses on a civilizational overthrow plot rather than just blaming elites or generic hidden motives."

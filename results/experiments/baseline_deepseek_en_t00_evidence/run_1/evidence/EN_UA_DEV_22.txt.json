      "reasoning": "The statement criticizes Western (European) politicians' motives, portraying their support for Ukraine as a cynical 'proxy war' against Russia that is against European interests and destructive."

      "evidence_quote": "“We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote predicts a severe negative consequence (the leveling of Western Europe) for the West if it continues its current policy of supporting Ukraine, framing it as a dire threat."

      "evidence_quote": "He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a “US problem.”",
      "reasoning": "By labeling the conflict a 'US problem', the speaker shifts the origin and responsibility for the war away from Russia and onto the United States, portraying it as an external issue imposed on Europe."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others (by framing Western support as the cause of Slavic deaths and a future threat), but it introduces a distinct, ethnically-charged argument not covered by the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a catastrophic escalation, framing continued support for Ukraine as a trigger for a pan-Slavic uprising that would destroy Western Europe, which aligns with the subnarrative of warning against actions that could lead to a broader, world-altering conflict (WWIII)."

      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by arguing that EU support is futile and self-destructive, fueling a conflict that harms European interests and Ukraine itself.

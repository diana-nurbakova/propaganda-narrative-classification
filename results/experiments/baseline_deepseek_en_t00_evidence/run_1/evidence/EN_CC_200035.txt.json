      "evidence_quote": "The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the economic impact and potential financial burden of the climate policy (mandating a 100% electric state fleet) on taxpayers, which aligns with the definition of criticizing the effectiveness or economic impact of climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This statement introduces skepticism and criticism of the green technology (EV/battery production) by associating its implementation with foreign geopolitical adversaries, suggesting controversy and negative consequences beyond environmental goals."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the green energy policy (EV fleet transition) as being intertwined with investments linked to a foreign power (CCP), implying the policy is a tool for or is influenced by geopolitical interests rather than being purely for environmental benefit."

      "evidence_quote": "The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights an unknown financial burden on taxpayers, framing the policy as potentially economically irresponsible and negatively impacting public finances."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote, and the subsequent discussion of Gotion and CATL, frames the policy as being driven by questionable foreign corporate investments and financial entanglements rather than pure environmental motives."

      "evidence_quote": "The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the policy by highlighting strong local opposition and political backlash, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "evidence_quote": "The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly highlights the unknown and potentially significant financial burden of the transition to electric vehicles, framing it as a costly and uncertain expense for taxpayers, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable/green technology is expensive."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote, and the subsequent paragraphs detailing partnerships with Chinese firms, introduces a controversy about green technology (EV/battery production) being linked to foreign geopolitical adversaries, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly links the state's green energy policy (electrifying the fleet) to investments involving Chinese corporations tied to the CCP, framing the policy as a vehicle for foreign (specifically Chinese) influence and control within the state, aligning with the concept of neo-colonialism where external powers exert control through economic initiatives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Gotion Inc., linked to the CCP, plans to build a $2.4 billion EV battery plant in the Big Rapids, Michigan, area at Whitmer’s behest.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by detailing a specific instance where a climate-related industrial project (an EV battery plant) is portrayed as being driven by, and benefiting, a foreign geopolitical actor (China/CCP). This argument—that green industrial policy serves foreign interests—is distinct from the 'neo-colonialism' subnarrative, which focuses more on control over developing nations, and is not covered by the other specific definition."

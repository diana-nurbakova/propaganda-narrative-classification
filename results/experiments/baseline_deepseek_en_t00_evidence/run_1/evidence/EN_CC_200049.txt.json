      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the severity of a climate change impact (heat-related mortality) by presenting alternative data to minimize the perceived problem, fitting the definition of downplaying climate change's significance."

      "evidence_quote": "According to data published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), over the past twenty years annual heat-related deaths in the U.S. have ranged between 0.9 and 3.6 per million people whereas cold-related deaths have ranged between 3.6 and 5.9 per million people.",
      "reasoning": "The text uses selective data from an official agency (EPA) to cast doubt on the scientific assertion (from Science Alert) about the leading cause of weather-related deaths, thereby raising questions about the validity of the climate science narrative."

      "reasoning": "The term 'Alarmists' in the headline is a pejorative label that challenges the credibility and motives of those raising climate concerns, aligning with the narrative of criticizing the climate movement."

      "evidence_quote": "According to the Lancet, people around the world are 9.4 times more likely to die from the cold than from the heat. It added that over the past 20 years, the death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that the negative impact of increased temperatures (heat-related deaths) is minimal and is outweighed by a decrease in cold-related deaths, suggesting the overall impact of climate change is not significant or is even beneficial in this specific metric."

      "reasoning": "This statement challenges a specific claim made by climate advocates (about heat being the leading cause of weather deaths) to undermine the perceived urgency and severity of climate change. It supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about natural cycles, human cause, or adaptation)."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the reliability of the claim about heat-related deaths being the leading cause, suggesting the underlying data or methodology used to support the climate change narrative is flawed and does not reflect the actual data (cold-related deaths are higher)."

      "reasoning": "This quote uses data to argue that the net effect of temperature changes (attributed to global warming) is a decrease in temperature-related mortality, thereby questioning the severity and negative impact of the claimed temperature increase."

      "reasoning": "The headline directly labels those warning about the heat dome as 'Alarmists,' framing their claims as exaggerated and sensationalist, which matches the definition of suggesting the climate movement exaggerates severity for dramatic effect."

This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.'"

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the war in Ukraine away from Russia, instead attributing responsibility to the West for a 'proxy war' and then accusing the West of falsely blaming China for enabling it."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes and delegitimizes NATO, portraying it not as a defensive alliance but as an aggressive tool of American expansionism, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Western institutions and diplomacy."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This highlights a negative outcome for the West (depleting weapons stocks without achieving victory), fitting the narrative of predicting or reporting adverse consequences for Western interests."

      "evidence_quote": "few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly undermines the credibility of Western mainstream media and official narratives, suggesting they propagate 'nonsense' that is not believed globally, which is a core element of the distrust towards media narrative."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear by stating that the US is 'globalising the war' and starting a 'third world war', which is a clear attempt to amplify anxieties about catastrophic, widespread conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement devalues Ukrainian lives and discredits the Ukrainian government by accusing it of forcibly conscripting men as 'cannon fodder', undermining Ukraine's actions and legitimacy."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China. So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the war's continuation and escalation onto the West, framing it as a 'proxy war' they are waging and failing at, while also accusing them of falsely blaming China."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West for prolonging and expanding the war, but it also introduces a distinct element of blaming Ukraine's own government ('Kyiv') for its conduct of the war, which does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as cleanly. It is a separate argument that shifts blame away from the invader."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly states that the West is willing to prolong the war in Ukraine for its own strategic benefit (expanding to Asia), showing a callous disregard for Ukrainian lives, which are dismissed as expendable 'cannon fodder'."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames the West's massive military support for Ukraine as excessive and futile ('still not winning'), while simultaneously mocking the Western narrative that China is the decisive factor, portraying the Western response as disproportionate and misguided."

      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying NATO not as a legitimate defensive alliance but as an aggressive, expansionist tool of American power, which is a distinct argument not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western military support for Ukraine is depleting their own arsenals ('emptying their own weapons warehouses') and is failing ('still not winning'), which catastrophizes the negative, backfiring effects of Western involvement."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western/American actions are leading to catastrophic global consequences—specifically, the expansion of conflict and the risk of a third world war—which is a negative consequence for the West and the world, but does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses Western mainstream newsrooms of being part of a 'disinformation war' and implies they are aligned with corridors of power, framing them as instruments of propaganda that produce 'nonsense' which few outside their sphere believe."

      "evidence_quote": "Given his obvious mental decline, US President Joe Biden may be forgiven for claiming to ABC News’ host George Stephanopoulos that he was indispensable: “You know, not only am I campaigning, but I’m running the world.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits a specific Western media outlet (ABC News) and its interview by framing the US President's claim as a product of 'mental decline', thereby casting doubt on the credibility and seriousness of the media interaction and the narratives it might convey, supporting the broader narrative of media distrust."

      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a third world war, framing the conflict's expansion as a deliberate act of globalizing war, which matches the definition of warning against actions that could lead to WW3."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition, then expand it to Asia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the conflict is being deliberately expanded from Eastern Europe to Asia, implying an imminent threat of attack spreading to other regions, aligning with the subnarrative that Russia will attack other countries."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "Alarmingly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Nato as playing a “bridge” between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific theatres.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests NATO is positioning itself to directly intervene and expand its military role into the Indo-Pacific, indicating a shift in strategy towards direct intervention in Asian conflicts."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "My Take | Nato barbarians are expanding and gathering at the gate of Asia",
      "reasoning": "This phrase supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by portraying NATO as a barbaric, expansionist force threatening Asia, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., WW3, nuclear weapons, attacking other countries, or NATO intervention). It is a distinct, fear-amplifying argument."

      "evidence_quote": "Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly portrays the Ukrainian government's mobilization efforts as desperate, inhumane, and incompetent, delegitimizing its policies and leadership by suggesting it treats its own citizens as expendable."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'proxy war' frames the conflict in Ukraine as a war fought by Ukraine on behalf of Western powers, implying that Ukraine is not an independent actor but a tool or puppet used by the West against Russia."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition... It’s just Ukrainian lives after all",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the war as an unwinnable, protracted conflict of attrition where Ukrainian lives are being sacrificed pointlessly by external powers, portraying a hopeless and grim future for Ukraine with no positive resolution."

      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by broadly dismissing the Western narrative about Ukraine as 'nonsense' and claiming global disbelief. It undermines the credibility of information supporting Ukraine but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not specifically about history, the military, nazism, etc.)."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the destruction of 'street zone sectioning barriers' as a form of resistance, implying these barriers are part of a climate policy (like low-traffic neighborhoods) that is being actively opposed and criticized for its impact."
    },

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' directly challenges and dismisses the rationale and actions of the climate movement, portraying it as irrational and worthy of resistance."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate change as 'The Climate Con' (a con or fraud) fundamentally downplays its reality and significance, suggesting it is a deceptive scheme rather than a genuine scientific and environmental issue."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames climate policies (specifically 'street zone sectioning barriers' as part of a 'climate change madness') as something so objectionable that direct, illegal resistance is justified and 'beautiful'. This criticizes the policies themselves but does not fit the specific definitions about ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive; it instead criticizes them as a form of oppressive 'madness' or 'con' to be resisted."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames the climate movement's agenda as irrational and hysterical, aligning with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist and exaggerating the issue."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate action as 'The Climate Con' (short for 'con' or confidence trick) directly alleges the movement is a fraudulent scheme, implying it is driven by deception and ulterior motives, which matches the definition of corruption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s very inspiring to see the people of the UK take matters into their own hands. This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly criticizes and encourages resistance against the climate movement ('The Climate Con'), supporting the parent narrative. However, the specific argument—that direct, physical resistance is justified and inspiring—does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate change action as irrational or extreme, which is a form of downplaying its seriousness and legitimacy, but does not fit any of the more specific scientific denial subnarratives provided."

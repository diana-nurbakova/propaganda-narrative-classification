      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained... the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers... the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "These statements collectively undermine Ukraine's military effectiveness and strategic position, portraying its government as incapable and its military as depleted and aging, which fits the narrative of discrediting Ukraine's actions and legitimacy in the conflict."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Western (and Ukrainian) policy as reckless and counterproductive, directly discrediting the diplomatic and military choices of the West by labeling them as pointless provocations that escalate the conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement blames the prolongation of the war on Ukraine and its Western allies for choosing escalation and provocation over negotiation, which supports the parent narrative of blaming others but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as neatly as the primary quote."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by stating their major offensive failed and resulted in a net loss of territory."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv... But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This statement portrays Ukraine's military situation as having no viable positive future, emphasizing an inability to achieve its goals and an inevitable loss of territory."

      "reasoning": "The text frames current Western policy as a fantasy of military victory, implicitly dismissing its viability, and explicitly calls for a shift to diplomacy ('work this conflict out with words'), suggesting the current path of military support is futile and diplomacy is the only sensible, albeit neglected, option."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But the West’s chosen depiction of Putin as a tyrant bent on conquering the entire European continent suffered its latest setback last month when it came out that the Russian president is interested in halting the fighting and negotiating a deal that recognizes the current battlefield lines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by discrediting the West's characterization of the conflict and its motives, arguing the West's narrative is false because Russia is portrayed as willing to negotiate. It fits the broad theme of discrediting Western diplomatic positions but does not align perfectly with the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, fatigue, or solely about Western self-interest in the defined sense)."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly warns against continuing a military offensive against Russia, framing it as a dangerous fantasy that could lead to a major war, and urges a diplomatic solution 'before it’s too late', evoking fear of a larger conflict akin to WWII."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly claims that current escalatory actions are increasing the risk of a 'catastrophic nuclear accident', directly evoking fear and anxiety about the potential use or accident involving nuclear weapons."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by describing a specific, risky escalation (allowing strikes inside Russia with NATO weapons) that heightens the danger and scale of the conflict, but it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarrative definitions provided."

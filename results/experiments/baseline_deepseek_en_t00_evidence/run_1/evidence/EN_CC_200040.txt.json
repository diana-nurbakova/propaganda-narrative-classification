    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Those \"Extinction Rebellion\" activists everyone loves to hate are at it again. After multiple instances of vandalism against famous landmarks and artistic works of western cultural significance, many people are growing annoyed with the actions of climate alarmists.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the climate movement by labeling activists as 'climate alarmists' and framing their actions as annoying vandalism that is counterproductive to their cause, challenging their motives and impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical statement '(it's not)' explicitly denies that man-made climate change is a legitimate threat, which directly minimizes the significance and validity of climate change."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda, blind belief in climate hysteria is on the decline.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda' questions the effectiveness and motives behind climate-related spending, framing it as wasteful 'propaganda' for a 'hysteria' that is declining."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This statement casts doubt on climate science by suggesting that predictions of global warming are exaggerated ('exploited') and fail to come true ('never seem to materialize'), thereby questioning the validity of the scientific forecasts."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate protests will likely increase in the next two months, with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames climate activists as exploiting normal seasonal weather to push exaggerated and unfulfilled predictions, aligning with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist and exaggerating the severity of climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "SEND THEM TO JAIL…or bury them under the fairway. Whatevs.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, presented as a social media reaction, constitutes a direct and extreme personal attack on the activists, calling for their imprisonment or burial, which fits the definition of ad hominem attacks on key figures in the movement."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Their defacement of Stonehenge could be considered relatively successful because no one was able to stop them. It's impossible to understand the logic behind the focus on an ancient site created thousands of year before the development of carbon based energy. However, climate activists seem to be more concerned with media coverage than making sense.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement's tactics as illogical, counterproductive, and primarily driven by a desire for media attention rather than genuine environmental concern. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks' as defined."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Human activities do not impact climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "This direct statement explicitly denies that human-caused (man-made) climate change is a real threat, fitting the definition of arguing climate change is not caused by human activity."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda, blind belief in climate hysteria is on the decline.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase frames mainstream climate science and concern as 'propaganda' and 'hysteria,' which supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but does not fit any of the specific scientific or impact-based subnarrative definitions provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda, blind belief in climate hysteria is on the decline.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that significant financial investment in climate-related messaging (a proxy for policy efforts) is failing to achieve its goal of convincing the public, implying the policies and their supporting narratives are ineffective."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by criticizing the climate movement's tactics and dismissing the core premise of man-made climate change, but it does not fit the definitions of the specific subnarratives about policy ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Data shows no temperature increase",
      "evidence_quote": "global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly asserts that the predicted outcomes of climate science (global warming) are not occurring, which aligns with the subnarrative that data does not support the claim of temperature increase."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly rejects the core scientific consensus that human activity drives climate change, supporting the parent narrative of questioning climate science. It does not fit the specific definitions about methodologies, data showing no increase, or the scientific community's reliability, but is a direct denial of the science."

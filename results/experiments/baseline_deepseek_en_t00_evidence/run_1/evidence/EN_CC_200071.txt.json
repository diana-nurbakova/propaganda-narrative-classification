      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of living (housing, fuel, utilities) to green policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames green policies as weakening national strength and resilience, suggesting they are tools that undermine geopolitical power rather than being driven by genuine environmental concern."

      "reasoning": "This statement expresses strong skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies (wind, solar, biomass), labeling them as inefficient, expensive, environmentally destructive, and incapable of meeting energy demands."

These are far more destructive to the environment... \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that the promoted renewable energy sources are inefficient, environmentally destructive, and incapable of meeting energy demands, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended environmental and practical goals."

      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",

      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the domestic economic consequences of green policies (unaffordable housing, energy) as a national security weakness, implying that these policies are a form of geopolitical self-sabotage that leaves the country vulnerable to adversaries, which aligns with the idea of international climate relations being exploitative or abusive to national strength."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Edward Ring, an author and a senior fellow with the conservative think tank, the California Policy Center, who warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'\"",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' is a direct characterization of green policies as an instrument of a broader, non-national (or supranational) political agenda, which supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments. This specific framing does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives, as it is more about subordinating national interests to a globalist agenda rather than explicit exploitation or colonialism."

      "evidence_quote": "\"BLINDED by MONEY: Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims wind farms are killing wildlife (eagles and whales), portraying renewable energy as posing significant risks and dangers to the environment."

      "evidence_quote": "The remainder of the fund will go toward implementing \"zero energy\" building codes, which will require residential buildings to install small-scale renewable energy generators \"to achieve zero-net carbon.\" This additional spending for owners of houses and residential buildings comes at a period in the United States when families are already struggling to afford a home.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative (controversy about green technologies) by framing green building codes and renewable energy mandates as direct drivers of housing unaffordability, a specific consequence not covered by the other subnarrative definitions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,'",

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement by blaming its policies for severe economic hardship (unaffordable housing, high energy costs). This supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks on key activists.' It is a distinct argument about negative societal consequences."

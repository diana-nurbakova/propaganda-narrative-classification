      "reasoning": "This statement glorifies Russia's territorial ambitions and asserts a historical and cultural claim over the Ukrainian city of Odesa, portraying its potential annexation as a positive and rightful return, which constitutes praise of Russia's actions and character."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests a decline in Ukrainian military effectiveness and strength by stating they are outnumbered, outgunned, and facing a critical shortage of aid, which supports the subnarrative of the Ukrainian army collapsing."

      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on a future war outcome (the capture of Kyiv) that does not fit the specific definitions of 'Russian army is collapsing', 'Russian army will lose all occupied territories', or 'Ukrainian army is collapsing'. It is a speculative prediction about territorial gains, thus falling under the 'Other' category for this parent narrative."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by highlighting its military failures, internal leadership turmoil (sacking of the top general), and the need for a desperate mobilization, which collectively undermine Ukraine's stability and competence but do not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage directly criticizes the UK government's inconsistent and seemingly contradictory policy decisions and personnel changes regarding climate and energy, challenging the competence and coherence of the authorities."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the government's climate policy approach by highlighting inconsistency and demoting key climate officials. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of being ineffective, economically harmful, or profit-driven."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the UK government's inconsistent and seemingly unserious approach to climate policy, highlighting policy reversals and the demotion of key climate officials, which fits the definition of disapproving of how national governments handle climate change."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames the Prime Minister's decision to attend COP27 as a reluctant reversal forced by pressure from various political figures and groups, implicitly criticizing his initial stance and judgment, which discredits a political figure in the context of the climate debate."

This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly labels Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites,' a term used to associate them with Stepan Bandera and, by extension, ultranationalist/Nazi ideology, which directly matches the subnarrative definition of accusing Ukrainian society or government of having ties to Nazi ideology."

      "reasoning": "This distorted statement presents the West (U.S.) as having an extreme, alarmist view of Russian actions (using WMDs), implying the West's rhetoric and concerns are disproportionate to the situation, which fits the 'overreacting' definition."

Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko [former deputy minister at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs], Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko. Extradition of various oligarchs, like [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky.”",
      "reasoning": "While not stating direct support, the quote implies Russia's power and future dominance will force international concessions (dissolution of NATO, extraditions), suggesting an expectation of Russia's will being imposed and accepted on the world stage, which aligns with the theme of Russia's international standing and influence."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that too costs money and we should get it back. The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.” ... “That was my next point. As well as the Antarctic... We discovered it, so it belongs to us... Also, the return of all medals that have been unlawfully taken from our sportsmen during all Olympic games... I think we should start voicing all of that, so they understand what will be on the table.”",
      "reasoning": "This extensive list of future demands (reparations, property return, territorial claims) portrays Russia as a powerful, victorious, and rightful claimant, supporting the overarching 'Praise of Russia' narrative. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about military, Putin, peace, or support, as it focuses on Russia's asserted historical rights and future spoils of victory."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to negotiate with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is being packaged as a sign of his love and good will, and not the consequence of mounting losses and humiliating defeats faced by the Russian military in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly states that the Russian military is facing 'mounting losses and humiliating defeats,' which is a clear statement suggesting a significant decline in its effectiveness and strength, aligning with the definition of the subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "According to top Kremlin propagandists, it’s only a matter of time before the West admits its defeat and pays reparations to Moscow or risks a devastating nuclear strike.",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on a future war outcome where the West is defeated and pays reparations, which supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes but does not fit the specific definitions about army collapse or loss of occupied territories. It is a distinct, speculative claim about the conflict's conclusion."

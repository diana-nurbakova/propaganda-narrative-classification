    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly frames a climate-related policy proposal (reducing laundry frequency) as an infringement on a fundamental right, which criticizes the policy's impact and motives."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the World Economic Forum, accusing it of hypocrisy and of targeting ordinary citizens while protecting elites."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "The text connects the WEF's climate policy advocacy (restricting laundry) with its praise for China's policies and its gathering of global elites, implying environmental initiatives are tools for geopolitical and elite consolidation rather than pure environmental concern."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly contrasts the proposed policy (restricting laundry) with the massive carbon footprint of the elites promoting it, implying the policy is hypocritical and ineffective at addressing the real sources of emissions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the climate policy as a restriction on consumer purchasing, which directly implies a negative impact on the clothing industry and broader economic activity tied to consumption."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that climate policies are designed to protect elite privileges and financial interests ('perks and privileges for billionaires') while imposing burdens on ordinary citizens, suggesting the policies serve a profit/power motive rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by framing climate policy as an extreme, rights-stripping measure that infringes on personal hygiene and dignity, which is a distinct criticism not captured by the other specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and 'ordering' governments, portraying it as an overreaching authority imposing unreasonable climate-related policies on the public."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits 'globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians' associated with the WEF, accusing them of hypocrisy by highlighting their high-carbon lifestyles while advocating for restrictive policies on ordinary citizens."

      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities (the WEF) but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives. It accuses the WEF of protecting elite privileges while designing environmental policies that target and strip rights from ordinary citizens, which is a broader criticism of its motives and actions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames international climate policy (promoted by the WEF) as an exploitative tool used by elites to abuse the rights of ordinary citizens while protecting their own privileges, fitting the definition of criticizing climate-related international relations as abusive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote, combined with the context of the article positioning the WEF as a globalist force imposing restrictive policies, suggests green/global governance is a geopolitical instrument for aligning with and praising specific national models (China), which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the more specific 'abusive' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions."

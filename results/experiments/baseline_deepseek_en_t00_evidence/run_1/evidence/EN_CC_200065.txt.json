      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly challenges the scientific basis for claims about long-term temperature records by highlighting the short duration of instrumental data collection, casting doubt on the methods used to make historical comparisons."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses a NASA statement to question the validity and comparability of paleoclimate proxy data, which is central to the scientific claims being reported, thereby sowing doubt about the scientific methodology."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely “the hottest day in thousands of years.”",
      "reasoning": "The term 'climate alarmists' is a pejorative label that challenges the credibility and motives of those raising climate concerns, framing their assertions as exaggerated or alarmist."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question sarcastically implies that the climate movement and media are prioritizing a sensational narrative over scientific accuracy, directly challenging their integrity and motives."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert that 2024 is “the planet’s hottest year yet since at least the pre-industrial era, and likely for at least 100,000 years before that” (emphasis added).",
      "reasoning": "The author describes the scientific claims as 'extravagant,' a term that minimizes their significance and suggests they are overstated or not to be taken seriously."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the reliability of the paleoclimate proxy data (tree rings, ice cores) used to make claims about temperatures thousands of years ago, framing them as fundamentally different and incompatible with direct measurements, thus casting doubt on the methodology."

      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that claims of record-breaking heat over millennia are unfounded because the instrumental record is too short, suggesting the data does not reliably support the assertion of a temperature increase over such long timescales."

      "evidence_quote": "The piece echoes claims by the once prestigious Lancet medical journal, which has averred that 2023 saw “the highest global temperatures in over 100,000 years.”",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'once prestigious' is used to discredit the Lancet, implying it has lost its credibility. This casts doubt on the reliability of the scientific institutions and journals making these climate claims."

      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question dismisses the entire scientific basis of the climate claims presented in the article, framing them as a sensationalist narrative rather than sound science. It supports the parent narrative of questioning the science but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about data, methodology, or the community's reliability."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by questioning the validity of claims about long-term temperature history, but its argument (that the instrumental record is too short to support such claims) does not perfectly fit the more specific definitions of questioning data, the greenhouse effect, or the scientific community's reliability. It is a distinct, leftover argument."

      "reasoning": "The opening phrase 'Climate alarmists' is a pejorative label, and the description of their claims as 'lamenting' frames their statements as exaggerated and emotionally driven rather than scientific, directly matching the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist."

      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question dismisses the scientific consensus and methodology (like paleoclimate data) presented in the article, framing climate concerns as a sensationalist narrative rather than evidence-based science. It supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but does not fit a more specific subnarrative definition."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the mayor's decision to travel to a climate summit, framing it as hypocritical and ineffective, thereby questioning the practical execution and impact of climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "White Garcetti was away, Los Angeles continued to struggle with the high crime and homelessness that have come to define his legacy, as well as a crisis in the City Council triggered by racist comments from City Council members within Garcetti’s party.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Mayor Garcetti's competence and priorities by highlighting domestic crises he is allegedly neglecting, challenging the integrity and effectiveness of his leadership in relation to his climate actions."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implicitly challenges the motives and practical choices of the climate movement (represented by the C40 summit), suggesting its actions may be performative or inefficient rather than genuinely focused on reducing emissions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific climate policy (the Green New Deal) by highlighting its political opposition and electoral failure, suggesting it is not achieving its intended goals, which aligns with the definition of policies being ineffective."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action – it’s a chance to elevate the solutions cities are deploying at a neighborhood level that have a real impact on people’s daily lives.",
      "reasoning": "The article frames the summit and Garcetti's participation as hypocritical and performative, implying the action is for show or political gain rather than genuine environmental concern, especially when contrasted with the carbon cost of his travel. The overall tone suggests the policies and summits are more about elevating profiles and solutions for appearance than substantive action."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the method of implementing climate policy (attending an in-person summit) as hypocritical and counterproductive, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive. It is a distinct argument about hypocrisy and misplaced priorities."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Mayor Eric Garcetti's performance and legacy, focusing on domestic failures (crime, homelessness, political crisis) while he is abroad, which discredits him as a political figure in the context of the climate change debate."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses disapproval of the decision-making and approach of the summit organizers (an institutional authority in the context of climate action) by questioning the necessity of in-person attendance, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit a more specific subnarrative like criticism of the EU, international entities, national governments, or a specific political figure/organization."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined a “global coalition of mayors” at a summit on climate change this week in Buenos Aires, Argentina, burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights hypocrisy by suggesting the mayor's actions (burning fossil fuels for travel) contradict the stated goals of the climate movement, implying the movement or its participants are not genuine and are engaged in unethical or self-serving practices."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by framing participation in a climate summit as a neglect of more immediate, serious local problems, which is a critique of the movement's priorities and effectiveness but does not fit the definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly questions the effectiveness and predicts catastrophic human consequences of the climate policy advocated by the Just Stop Oil movement, framing it as genocidal."

      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda. As the end of the biblical age of grace approaches, the world is increasingly coming unhinged, including environmentally as the birth pangs intensify. The theory that climate fanatics have adopted...",
      "reasoning": "The text characterizes the climate movement ('climate fanatics') as being driven by propaganda and a delusional belief system ('appease the climate gods'), challenging their motives and intellectual integrity."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "even though the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This statement minimizes the significance of human-caused emissions by claiming natural sources are far greater, thereby downplaying the human impact on climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "(Related: According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.)",
      "reasoning": "The embedded quote directly raises doubts about the scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, challenging the consensus supporting such policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "The text vividly amplifies fears about the consequences of implementing climate policies, predicting immediate, apocalyptic societal collapse and mass death on a global scale."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that implementing the climate policy (stopping oil use) would fail to achieve its intended environmental goal and instead lead to catastrophic human death, framing the policy as fundamentally ineffective and counterproductive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "On the very first day of an oil- and gas-free world... all homes, businesses, and other structures that rely on either or both of these for light, heat, fuel, or what have you would no longer function.",
      "reasoning": "This quote describes a scenario where the cessation of fossil fuel use would cause the immediate collapse of basic societal and economic functions, directly claiming a severe negative economic and infrastructural impact from the proposed climate policy."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by challenging the scientific basis for climate policies, arguing that natural emissions dwarf human contributions. This is a criticism of the rationale behind the policies but does not fit the definitions of 'ineffective', 'negative economic impact', or 'only for profit'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'fear of \"boiling oceans\"' uses hyperbolic and dramatic language to characterize the climate movement's warnings as exaggerated and alarmist."

      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda.",

      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes the climate movement by claiming its proposed actions would lead to catastrophic, genocidal human death, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem' subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that natural sources (volcanoes) emit far more greenhouse gases than human activities (cars, cattle), thereby arguing that human activities are not the primary driver of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by citing an authority figure to claim there is no scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, which is a form of downplaying the need for climate action. It does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses a statement from a COP28 president to claim there is no scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels, which serves to discredit the scientific consensus and the actions of the climate science community."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Do you believe the planet is melting or boiling due to man-made climate change? Learn more about why this is not the case at Climate.news.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly questions the validity of the science behind man-made climate change claims ('melting or boiling') and directs readers to a source that argues 'this is not the case,' supporting the parent narrative but not fitting a more specific subnarrative definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "The headline directly presents an intense catastrophic scenario (six billion deaths) as a predicted result of acting on climate change mitigation, which aligns with the definition of presenting doomsday scenarios for humans."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming",
      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'boiling oceans destroying the planet' is a hyperbolic and panic-inducing amplification of the existing scientific concern about ocean warming and its effects."

      "evidence_quote": "As the end of the biblical age of grace approaches, the world is increasingly coming unhinged, including environmentally as the birth pangs intensify.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by framing environmental changes as apocalyptic 'birth pangs' tied to a religious end-times prophecy, which amplifies climate fears but does not fit any of the other specific subnarrative definitions."

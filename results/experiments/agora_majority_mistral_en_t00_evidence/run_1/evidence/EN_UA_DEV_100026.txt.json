      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for Germany's economic struggles away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and instead attributes the negative consequences to the sanctions imposed by the West and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, implying that the West is responsible for Germany's energy crisis."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing. As a result, Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the Western-imposed sanctions regime and portrays it as a failed policy that has harmed Germany, implying incompetence or malice in Western diplomatic efforts."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The German economy, the fourth-largest in the world, has ground to a standstill. There is no growth. Manufacturing is depressed, trade is weak, inflation is high, and jobs are scarce. Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the severe economic downturn in Germany, a key Western nation, attributing it to policies and actions (e.g., sanctions, energy transition) that are framed as detrimental to Western interests."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'virtue signals their way to perdition' implies that German leaders are acting based on misleading or propagandistic narratives promoted by media or political elites, fostering distrust in the information ecosystem."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "Facing intense pressure from green politicians and evangelists of a looming climate apocalypse, Germany embarked on a plan to completely eliminate coal and other fossil fuels from its energy complex.",
      "reasoning": "The text suggests that Germany's energy policies were driven by hidden agendas or secret schemes of powerful groups (e.g., 'green politicians and evangelists') rather than pragmatic or transparent decision-making."

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for Germany's economic struggles onto the 'sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West,' portraying the West as the aggressors responsible for the conflict's consequences rather than Russia, the invader."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not directly blame Ukraine or the West, it reinforces the parent narrative by emphasizing the negative consequences of the disruption of Russian gas supplies, implicitly framing the war as a problem caused by external factors rather than Russia's invasion. This supports the broader theme of deflecting responsibility from Russia."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the West's response to Russia's actions (sanctions and other measures) is disproportionate and harmful, particularly to Germany, implying an overreaction."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error... Why should German industry be sacrificed to benefit other economies at the expense of their own?",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that Western (specifically German) leaders are prioritizing abstract global goals (e.g., climate policy) over the well-being of their own citizens, suggesting that their support for Ukraine or broader geopolitical actions is self-serving rather than altruistic."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights disparities within the EU, suggesting that member states are affected differently by Western policies, implying division and lack of unified action or interests."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western policies (sanctions, energy transitions) but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It emphasizes the negative consequences of Western actions on specific EU countries, reinforcing the idea of misguided or harmful Western diplomacy."

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly links the Western sanctions on Russia to negative economic consequences for Germany, such as the need to find alternative (and more expensive) energy sources, which aligns with the subnarrative that sanctions will backfire on the West."

      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting the broader economic suffering (high electricity prices and inflation) in Europe due to the conflict and sanctions, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It emphasizes the negative consequences for the West without directly attributing them to refugee flows or a specific backfire of sanctions."

      "evidence_quote": "Virtue-Signaling Straight Into the Abyss... While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies that Western (including German) media and leadership are promoting a misguided 'green' agenda that harms their own economies while other nations (e.g., China) ignore such narratives. This discredits Western media and institutions by framing them as propagandists for an unrealistic and destructive policy, aligning with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s beleaguered citizens appear to have had enough of this disaster. Political change is in the winds. The populist conservative party, Alternative for Germany, has just emerged as Germany’s second strongest party, polling at 20 percent support nationwide and more than one-third in some regions. One of the party’s main selling points is that it’s 'an aggressive opponent of the government’s energy and climate policy.'",
      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by suggesting that mainstream media and political institutions have failed to represent the will of the people, leading to a rise in populist opposition. While it doesn’t fit the specific subnarratives directly, it reinforces the broader theme of media and institutional distrust by implying that the public is rejecting the dominant narrative pushed by these entities."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the economic downturn in Germany is not merely a result of poor policy decisions but is instead driven by hidden, coordinated actions by powerful Western groups (e.g., the U.S. and its allies) to impose sanctions and sabotage infrastructure, implying a deliberate scheme to weaken Germany."

      "evidence_quote": "German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow",
      "reasoning": "This implies that German leaders are complicit in a broader, possibly orchestrated effort by global elites or foreign powers (e.g., China) to undermine Germany's economy under the guise of climate policy, suggesting a hidden agenda rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Why should German industry be sacrificed to benefit other economies at the expense of their own?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames Germany's economic decline as a deliberate sacrifice orchestrated by unseen powerful groups (e.g., global elites or foreign governments) to advantage other economies, reinforcing the idea of a hidden plot."

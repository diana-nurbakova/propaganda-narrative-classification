      "evidence_quote": "Russia-linked accounts are disseminating divisive content aimed at U.S. audiences, including criticizing American support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, researchers at the tech giant said in a report.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that the conflict is framed as a result of American support for Ukraine, shifting blame away from Russia's invasion and instead criticizing U.S. involvement."

      "evidence_quote": "That content is then covered by a network of websites that include DC Weekly, Miami Chronical and The Intel Drop. Ultimately, after the narrative has circulated online for a series of days or weeks, U.S. audiences repeat and repost this disinformation, likely unaware of its original source.",
      "reasoning": "The quote undermines confidence in media sources by suggesting that disinformation is spread through seemingly legitimate websites, leading audiences to unknowingly consume and propagate false narratives."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions Russian accounts criticizing American support for Ukraine, implying that the U.S. (part of the Western block) is responsible for prolonging or escalating the conflict, which aligns with the subnarrative of shifting blame to the West."

      "evidence_quote": "Messaging regarding Ukraine - via traditional media and social media - picked up steam over the last two months with a mix of covert and overt campaigns from at least 70 Russia-affiliated activity sets we track... Ultimately, after the narrative has circulated online for a series of days or weeks, U.S. audiences repeat and repost this disinformation, likely unaware of its original source.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by describing Russian efforts to shape perceptions of the war, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West directly. Instead, it focuses on the broader mechanism of disinformation dissemination, which is a distinct but related argument supporting the parent narrative."

That content is then covered by a network of websites that include DC Weekly, Miami Chronical and The Intel Drop. 'Ultimately, after the narrative has circulated online for a series of days or weeks, U.S. audiences repeat and repost this disinformation, likely unaware of its original source,' Microsoft said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly describes a Russian disinformation campaign where content is disseminated through seemingly independent media outlets, implying that Western media (or media posing as Western) can be manipulated to spread disinformation. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda, as it suggests these outlets are being used to shape narratives without audiences' awareness."

      "evidence_quote": "Microsoft said Wednesday Russian online campaigns to influence the upcoming U.S. presidential election kicked into gear over the past 45 days, but at a slower pace than in past elections. Russia-linked accounts are disseminating divisive content aimed at U.S. audiences, including criticizing American support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, researchers at the tech giant said in a report.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit the specific subnarratives of distrust toward Western or Ukrainian media, it supports the parent narrative by implying that media narratives (in this case, those criticizing U.S. support for Ukraine) are being artificially amplified by foreign actors to sow distrust and division. This suggests a broader undermining of media trustworthiness beyond the specific subnarratives provided."

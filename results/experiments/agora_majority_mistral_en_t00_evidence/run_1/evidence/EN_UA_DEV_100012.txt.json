      "evidence_quote": "Washington 'cannot afford' to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that the U.S. (and by extension, the West) is responsible for prolonging the conflict by prioritizing access to Ukraine's resources, shifting blame away from Russia's invasion."

      "evidence_quote": "'Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the legitimacy and character of Ukraine's government by labeling it as corrupt and neo-Nazi, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine."

'The fate of the colonies is always the same: the Americans will scoop up all the natural resources of Ukraine in exchange for 'the great honor of being a friend of the United States'.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the U.S. and Western intentions, portraying them as exploitative and hypocritical in their foreign policy, which fits the definition of discrediting the West."

      "reasoning": "The framing suggests Russia is highlighting Western exploitation of Ukraine, indirectly portraying Russia as a victim of Western expansionism and resource-driven aggression."

      "reasoning": "While this quote is attributed to a U.S. senator, the text does not explicitly endorse it. However, the repetition of the quote without counter-narrative framing could indirectly amplify the idea of Western benevolence, though this is a weaker example."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by further blaming the West for exploiting Ukraine and propping up a corrupt regime, but it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors.'

      "reasoning": "The quote frames Western actions as inherently exploitative and dismissive of Russian concerns, implying that the West's interest in Ukraine is driven by a broader anti-Russian agenda rather than legitimate economic or strategic interests.

      "reasoning": "The text explicitly directs the reader to Sputnik's infographics, implying that Western media (e.g., CBS News) is not trustworthy or is distorting the narrative. This discredits Western media by suggesting it is hiding or misrepresenting the true motives behind the West's involvement in Ukraine, framing it as propaganda."

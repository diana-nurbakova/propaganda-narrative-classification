      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Zaluzhny is a fitting representative, with blood on his hands. That he was appointed ambassador to the UK in March confirms the SEP’s insistence that a major escalation of NATO’s proxy war against Russia is being prepared.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly attacks the legitimacy and moral character of a high-ranking Ukrainian official, implying criminality and associating him with negative outcomes (e.g., 'blood on his hands'). This aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine by undermining its representatives and actions."
    },

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The appointment of Zaluzhny to London ensures that Britain remains a centre of intrigue to implement the most brutal and dangerous war policy since 1945 with no public discussion and no democratic mandate whatsoever.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes British imperialism and its role in the war, portraying it as undemocratic and dangerous. This aligns with the narrative of discrediting Western diplomatic and military efforts."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "the intention was to deliver a letter demanding the release of our comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk to the ambassador. The SBU secret service are attempting to frame Bogdan, a Trotskyist opponent of NATO’s proxy war, the Zelensky regime and of Russia’s invasion, as a supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that the war is a 'NATO proxy war' and shifts blame away from Russia's invasion by framing the conflict as driven by Western actions. This aligns with the narrative of blaming others for the war."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Building a new anti-war movement demands an irrevocable break with the capitalist media, the major parties, the trade unions and what passes for the ‘left’ over the acute dangers facing the working class…",
      "reasoning": "The quote undermines confidence in media organizations by labeling them as 'capitalist media' and part of a 'conspiracy of silence,' which aligns with the narrative of distrust towards media."

      "reasoning": "The quote evokes fear by suggesting that the war policy being implemented is 'the most brutal and dangerous since 1945,' amplifying concerns about severe consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "the nakedly criminal character of the Ukrainian regime and its frame-up of Bogdan",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly delegitimizes the Ukrainian government by portraying it as criminal and engaged in framing political opponents, which aligns with the subnarrative's definition of undermining the government's legitimacy."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "He led Ukraine’s disastrous 'counter-offensive' last year, which led to the deaths of at least 125,000 soldiers. Overall, the war has claimed the lives of at least 400,000 Ukrainian soldiers.",
      "reasoning": "This statement undermines the effectiveness and professionalism of the Ukrainian military by highlighting the failure of the counter-offensive and the high number of casualties, which fits the subnarrative's definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Zaluzhny now serves as a point man between the Ukrainian regime and its military and British imperialism, with the full support of his arch rival. Zelensky said of the appointment of Zaluzhny, 'Our alliance with Britain must only grow stronger.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Ukraine is heavily influenced and controlled by Western powers, particularly Britain, portraying Ukraine as a puppet of the West."

      "evidence_quote": "Above all, he has established a close relationship with the country’s far-right. He has publicly expressed admiration for the Ukrainian fascist leader Stepan Bandera and has been photographed repeatedly with far-right paraphernalia... He appointed the leader of the fascist Right Sector organisation Dmytro Yarosh as his advisor.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly ties the Ukrainian military leadership to Nazi collaborators and far-right ideology, which aligns with the subnarrative's definition of associating Ukraine with nazism."

With Labour preparing to implement a major escalation of the war following a scheduled NATO conference on July 9-12, Zaluzhny can and must play a key role.",
      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative by implying that Ukraine is part of a broader, undemocratic, and dangerous Western war strategy, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided. Thus, it qualifies for 'Other'."

This has taken on additional significance as a result of the snap general election scheduled for July 4, with Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party most likely replacing the crisis-ridden Conservative government of Rishi Sunak. With Labour preparing to implement a major escalation of the war following a scheduled NATO conference on July 9-12, Zaluzhny can and must play a key role.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the UK's appointment of Zaluzhny as ambassador is driven by its own strategic interests in escalating the war against Russia, rather than any genuine concern for Ukraine's well-being or democratic processes. It frames the West's actions as self-serving and manipulative."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "White House anxiety about the US appearing to be closely involved in the Ukraine war has meant that Radakin’s opposite number in the Pentagon, Gen Mark Milley, has been barred from travelling to Ukraine. But Britain, whose military is far smaller than the US, has no such concerns.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a division within the Western alliance, specifically between the US and the UK, regarding their level of involvement and public visibility in the Ukraine war. It portrays the West as lacking a unified stance, which aligns with the subnarrative of the EU (or broader West) being divided."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by discrediting the West's diplomatic and military actions as undemocratic and secretive, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided. It emphasizes the lack of transparency and public consent in Western policy, which is a distinct argument within the broader discrediting framework."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by implying that the Ukrainian regime (and by extension, its Western backers) is responsible for the conflict's escalation and repression, rather than Russia. While it does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'Ukraine as the aggressor' or 'The West as the aggressors' directly, it still shifts blame away from Russia and aligns with the broader parent narrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote further reinforces the idea that the UK and its allies are the primary drivers of the war's brutality and escalation, deflecting responsibility from Russia. It supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, hence the use of 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "While the text cites *The Guardian* as a source, it does so in a way that frames the reporting as part of a broader narrative of Western media complicity in promoting NATO's war agenda. The detailed inclusion of Sabbagh's reporting, followed by criticism of the lack of public discussion and democratic mandate, suggests that Western media is being used to legitimize war policies without scrutiny, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives."

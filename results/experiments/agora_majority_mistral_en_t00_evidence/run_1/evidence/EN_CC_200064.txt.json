      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage during Sweden’s Strictly Come Dancing final over the weekend.",
      "reasoning": "The text describes the climate activists as 'radical' and highlights the disruptive nature of their protest, which challenges the motives and impact of the climate movement by portraying them as reckless or extreme."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote from the activist group explicitly emphasizes and amplifies fears about the consequences of climate change, framing it as an existential threat to society."

  ],
  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The quote from the activist group's statement suggests an extreme and dramatic portrayal of climate change, which aligns with the subnarrative that the climate movement exaggerates the severity of climate issues for effect."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the Swedish Dance Show... The three activists jumped onto the stage, stood in front of the studio camera, released yellow paint powder, and unfurled a large banner... their stunt was short lived, with a large camera on a crane quickly swooping in and knocking down a male activist.",
      "reasoning": "The text describes the activists' actions as disruptive and radical, portraying them in a negative light by emphasizing the chaos and potential danger caused by their protest. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote presents an intense catastrophic scenario as a result of climate change, directly aligning with the definition of 'Doomsday scenarios for humans.' It suggests widespread and severe consequences, amplifying fears of an impending collapse."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase supports the parent narrative by framing climate activism as an urgent, fear-driven cause that justifies disruptive actions, even though it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. It amplifies the perceived severity of climate issues to rationalize extreme behavior."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing Whitmer's administration for its handling of international partnerships and economic outcomes, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives.

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly links Michigan's green policies to investments from Chinese corporations tied to the CCP, framing these relationships as exploitative and abusive.

      "evidence_quote": "Michigan is on the cutting-edge of mobility and electrification. Our world-leading auto industry is making the switch to electric, and we continue to attract battery, semiconductor, and clean energy investments from other states and nations. We must usher the future of mobility and clean energy into Michigan by winning projects and leading by example in state government.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism,' it supports the parent narrative by framing green policies as a tool for geopolitical competition and economic influence. The emphasis on 'winning projects' and attracting investments from other states and nations suggests that green policies are being used as instruments of state power and economic strategy, which aligns with the broader theme of green policies as geopolitical tools."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly criticizes climate policies by framing street zoning barriers (likely part of traffic or emissions reduction measures) as unjust or oppressive, implying they are ineffective or harmful."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' suggests a narrative that institutions and authorities are deceiving the public, challenging their integrity and intentions regarding climate change policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' directly challenges the motives and impact of the climate movement, portraying it as irrational or extreme."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'The Climate Con' implies a belief in a hidden agenda or secret scheme by powerful groups (e.g., governments, institutions) to manipulate the public under the guise of climate action."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The destruction of street zoning barriers implies that residents view these climate-related measures as ineffective or counterproductive, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' frames climate policies as deceptive or fraudulent, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other subnarrative definitions. This phrase reinforces the idea that climate policies are not genuine but does not specify economic or effectiveness concerns."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers... Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the UK government's climate policies by framing them as 'climate change madness' and portraying resistance against government-imposed street zoning barriers as justified. This directly disapproves of how the national government is handling climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Piers Corbyn and friends are taking to the streets on Friday the 13th of January.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of Piers Corbyn, a political figure associated with opposition to climate policies, implies discrediting of political organizations and figures involved in the climate change debate, particularly those supporting climate action."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'The Climate Con' broadly criticizes institutions and authorities involved in climate policy by framing their efforts as deceptive or fraudulent. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' suggests that the climate movement is exaggerating the severity of climate change, framing it as irrational or overly dramatic, which aligns with the definition of the subnarrative 'Climate movement is alarmist'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' implies that the climate movement is deceptive or fraudulent, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks. This constitutes a remainder that aligns with the 'Other' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers... resistance to the climate change madness in the UK... The Great Climate Con... resistance to The Climate Con",
      "reasoning": "The text frames climate policies (e.g., 'street zone sectioning barriers') as part of a deceptive scheme ('The Climate Con') orchestrated by powerful, unseen groups. This implies a hidden agenda rather than addressing the policies on their merits, aligning with the parent narrative of secret plots by powerful groups. The term 'con' explicitly suggests manipulation, but the text does not fit a more specific subnarrative, so 'Other' is appropriate."

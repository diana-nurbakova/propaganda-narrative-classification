      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, by labeling its climate policies as 'tyrannical' and implying undue influence over 'American elites.' This aligns with the subnarrative definition of criticizing the role and influence of international entities on climate policy."

      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes 'America’s wealthiest citizens' and the Committee to Unleash Prosperity (CUP) by framing their support for the WEF's policies as elitist and out of touch. This discredits political or socio-economic figures and organizations in the context of the climate change debate."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the beliefs of 'American elites' as disconnected from reality, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided. It serves as additional evidence of disapproval of influential groups, warranting inclusion under 'Other.'"

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the mindset of elites supporting climate policies but does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives.

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames the WEF and 'American elites' as engaging in a hidden, tyrannical plot to impose rationing policies on the general public under the guise of climate change. This aligns with the parent narrative of hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups, but does not fit a more specific subnarrative, thus falling under 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "Astonishingly, the polling shows that almost 90 percent of 'American elites' believe strict rationing of gas, meat, and electricity is necessary to combat the so-called 'climate crisis.' The CUP report shows that 77 percent of higher-income Americans overall support these plans. However, 89 percent of those wealthy individuals from 'top universities' believe in restrictions on the public’s quality of life to meet 'Net Zero.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote reinforces the idea of a coordinated effort by a powerful, educated elite to impose restrictive policies on the public, suggesting a hidden agenda.

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames the WEF's climate policies as a form of control or coercion imposed by an international body (WEF) on the general public, portraying these policies as abusive or exploitative in nature. The use of terms like 'ration' and 'force compliance' underscores the perceived oppressive character of these policies."

      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that a global elite (represented by the WEF and wealthy individuals from top universities) is imposing restrictive policies on the general public, which can be interpreted as a form of neo-colonialism. The emphasis on 'top universities' and the WEF implies a power dynamic where developed or elite groups dictate terms to the broader population, mirroring colonial control."

They are defined as 'people having at least one post-graduate degree, earning at least $150,000 annually, and living in high-population density areas...'",
      "reasoning": "This quote reinforces the parent narrative by highlighting the divide between the elite (who support green policies) and the general public, framing the elite's support for such policies as a tool of control or influence. While it does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism,' it still supports the broader idea that green policies are geopolitical instruments used by elites to exert power."

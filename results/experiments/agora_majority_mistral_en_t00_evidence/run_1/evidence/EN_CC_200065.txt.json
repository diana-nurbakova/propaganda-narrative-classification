      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely 'the hottest day in thousands of years.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'climate alarmists' is used pejoratively to challenge the motives and integrity of those advocating for climate action, implying they are exaggerating or sensationalizing the issue. This directly aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The text raises doubts about the scientific methods and data used to assert historical temperature records, specifically questioning the reliability of proxy records like tree rings and ice cores. This fits the definition of questioning the measurements and science."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase minimizes the significance of climate change by suggesting that claims about record temperatures are exaggerated or dramatized for effect, rather than being based on serious scientific concern. This aligns with downplaying climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "the once prestigious Lancet medical journal, which has averred that 2023 saw 'the highest global temperatures in over 100,000 years.'",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'once prestigious' implies that the Lancet has lost credibility, challenging the integrity and competence of a respected institution. This fits the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely 'the hottest day in thousands of years.' ... Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert that 2024 is 'the planet’s hottest year yet since at least the pre-industrial era, and likely for at least 100,000 years before that' (emphasis added).",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly labels climate activists as 'alarmists' and criticizes their claims as 'extravagant' and exaggerated, suggesting they are overstating the severity of climate change for dramatic effect. This directly aligns with the definition of the subnarrative 'Climate movement is alarmist.'"

      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase undermines the credibility of the climate movement by implying that its claims are driven by narrative rather than scientific evidence. While it supports the parent narrative (criticism of the climate movement), it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks,' thus qualifying for 'Other.'"

      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, 'scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,' NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the reliability of methodologies (proxy records like tree rings and ice cores) used to estimate historical temperatures, suggesting they are not comparable to direct measurements and thus unreliable."

      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies that claims of record-breaking temperatures over long historical periods (e.g., 'hottest day in thousands of years') are unsupported by direct data, as reliable temperature records only exist from the 19th century onward."

      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",

      "evidence_quote": "According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), three of the world’s most complete temperature tracking records... only began in 1880.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting limitations in historical temperature data, it does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives. It emphasizes the lack of comprehensive data before 1880, which undermines claims about long-term temperature trends."

      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies that current temperature records are insignificant in the context of Earth's long-term natural climate cycles, suggesting that climate change is a natural occurrence rather than a recent anomaly."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase dismisses the scientific basis of climate change claims, supporting the parent narrative by undermining the credibility of climate data and research without fitting a specific subnarrative definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Temperature increase does not have significant impact",
      "evidence_quote": "Although sporadic attempts to measure temperature were made previously, 'there are too few data before 1880 for scientists to estimate average temperatures for the entire planet,' NASA has concluded.",
      "reasoning": "The text emphasizes the limitations of historical temperature data to cast doubt on the significance of current temperature increases, implying they may not be as impactful or unprecedented as claimed."

      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the Lancet, an international medical journal, for making claims about climate data that the author disputes based on the limitations of historical temperature records. This aligns with the subnarrative of criticizing international entities' role in climate policy and discourse."

      "evidence_quote": "'We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate keeps warming, we are bound to see new records being broken in future months and years,' states Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service in Europe.",
      "reasoning": "The text critiques Carlo Buontempo, a political figure associated with a European climate service, by framing his statement as part of an 'alarmist' narrative and questioning the validity of such claims. This fits the subnarrative of discrediting political organizations and figures in the climate change debate."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",

While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided, thus qualifying for 'Other'."

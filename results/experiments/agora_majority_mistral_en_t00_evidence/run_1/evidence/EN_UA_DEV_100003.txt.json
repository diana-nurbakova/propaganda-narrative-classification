      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the narrative of Russia's invasion being an 'imperial-style land grab' is a Western and Ukrainian fabrication, shifting blame away from Russia's actions and portraying Russia as unfairly accused."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights Russia's confidence in its military progress and strategic position, portraying Russia's actions and prospects in a positive light."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the West's diplomatic and political processes, suggesting inefficiency or failure in supporting Ukraine, thereby discrediting Western efforts."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.",
      "reasoning": "Medvedev explicitly speculates about future military actions and outcomes, predicting the potential capture of Kyiv, which fits the definition of speculating war outcomes."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for the conflict by implying that the West and Ukraine are falsely portraying Russia's actions as aggressive, while Russia's own statements about territorial expansion (e.g., Kyiv and Odesa) are framed as justified. This aligns with the subnarrative of portraying the West as the true aggressors or instigators of the conflict."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev said Russia also wanted to take the Black Sea port of Odesa... 'Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city.'",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by justifying Russia's territorial ambitions as natural or historical, rather than framing them as aggressive. It does not fit the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West directly but still shifts focus away from Russia's role as the invader."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian troops will go much further into Ukraine, taking the southern city of Odesa and might even one day push on to the capital Kyiv... After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization... Russia is now seeking to recapture the initiative across the 1,000 km (600-mile) front line, where its troops are dug in behind deep mine fields patrolled by drones and guarded by heavy artillery.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights Russia's military capabilities, territorial advances, and strategic positioning, portraying its forces as resilient, well-equipped, and capable of further expansion. This directly aligns with the subnarrative of praising Russian military might."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin said Tuesday that Russian troops would push further into Ukraine to build on their success on the battlefield after the weekend fall of the town of Avdiivka where he said Ukrainian troops had been forced to flee in chaos.",
      "reasoning": "The quote attributes military success and strategic foresight to Putin, presenting him as an effective leader who is guiding Russia to victory. This supports the subnarrative of praising Vladimir Putin."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Russian invasion has strong national support",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev said Russia also wanted to take the Black Sea port of Odesa, which it calls Odessa. 'Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,' Medvedev said.",
      "reasoning": "The statement frames the invasion as a widely supported national endeavor, emphasizing historical and cultural ties to justify territorial claims. This implies strong domestic backing for the invasion, aligning with the subnarrative of national support."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict... Russia currently controls a little under one fifth of territory internationally recognized to be Ukraine. Russian forces expected a quick victory in 2022 but Ukrainian forces pushed Russian forces back later that year in a counteroffensive which showed serious problems in Russia's military. Russia is now seeking to recapture the initiative...",
      "reasoning": "While the text acknowledges past military setbacks, it frames Russia's current position as one of renewed strength and confidence, supporting the parent narrative of praising Russia. This does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but still contributes to the overarching theme of portraying Russia positively."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the West, particularly the U.S., is unable to act decisively or effectively to support Ukraine, implying weakness in its resolve and capability."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The West has committed about 250 billion euros ($271 billion) worth of aid to Ukraine in an attempt to defeat Russian forces",
      "reasoning": "The phrasing 'in an attempt to defeat Russian forces' subtly frames Western aid as a strategic move to counter Russia rather than a genuine concern for Ukraine's sovereignty or well-being, aligning with the subnarrative that the West is self-interested."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin's suggestion of a ceasefire in Ukraine to freeze the war was rejected by the United States after contacts between intermediaries",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights the rejection of diplomatic efforts (ceasefire proposal) by the U.S., implying that diplomacy is ineffective or doomed to fail, which aligns with the subnarrative."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying the West's warnings as exaggerated or unfounded (since Putin denies them), which discredits Western diplomatic and strategic narratives but does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army will lose all the occupied territories",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly states Ukraine's intention to reclaim all occupied territories, implying a speculative outcome where Russia loses control of these areas. It directly aligns with the subnarrative definition of predicting Russia's loss of occupied territories."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sacked his top general.",
      "reasoning": "This statement speculates on the war's trajectory by highlighting Ukraine's struggles (e.g., failed counteroffensive, leadership changes) and Russia's strategic advantage, supporting the parent narrative of war outcome speculation. However, it does not fit the specific subnarratives of either army collapsing or losing territories, hence classified as 'Other'."

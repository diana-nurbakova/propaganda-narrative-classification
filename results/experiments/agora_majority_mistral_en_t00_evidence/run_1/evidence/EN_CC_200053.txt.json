      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Sunak has been sending mixed signals about his government’s energy and climate policies. The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the consistency and effectiveness of the UK government's climate policies, implying a lack of clear direction and commitment, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote discredits Sunak and his government's inconsistent climate policies and decisions, such as demoting key climate figures, which fits the subnarrative of criticizing political organizations and figures in the context of climate change."

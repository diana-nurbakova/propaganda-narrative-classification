      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame to Ukraine by highlighting its drone attacks on Russian territory, implying Ukraine is the aggressor rather than Russia, which initiated the invasion."

      "evidence_quote": "the notorious Starokonstantinov airfield in the Khmelnitsk region. Ukrainian Su-24MR aircraft of the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade are based at there. They are the main carriers of Storm Shadow / SCALP cruise missiles.",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'notorious' to describe a Ukrainian airfield, combined with the emphasis on Ukraine's use of missiles, subtly undermines Ukraine's military actions and portrays them negatively."

      "evidence_quote": "Russian forces continue massive strikes throughout Ukraine. Over the past night, at least seven large explosions thundered in the town of Chuguev in the Kharkiv region. The local authorities confirmed that the Russian attack was successful but did not reveal its target, claiming that there were no casualties among the civilians.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the success of Russian strikes and their precision (no civilian casualties), which serves to positively portray Russia's military capabilities and effectiveness."

More explosions thundered in the area of the notorious Starokonstantinov airfield in the Khmelnitsk region. Ukrainian Su-24MR aircraft of the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade are based at there. They are the main carriers of Storm Shadow / SCALP cruise missiles.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for the conflict by emphasizing that Ukrainian aircraft are armed with Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles, implying that the West is enabling or escalating the aggression against Russia rather than acknowledging Russia's role as the invader."

The local sources are hiding any information about the damage, but some supposed that another facility used for accommodation of Ukrainian servicemen was hit.",
      "reasoning": "This quote subtly supports the parent narrative by implying that Ukrainian military facilities (and thus Ukraine's war effort) are legitimate targets, while omitting the broader context of Russia's invasion as the root cause of the conflict. This does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but still aligns with the broader theme of deflecting blame."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainian sources are hiding any information about the damage, but some supposed that another facility used for accommodation of Ukrainian servicemen was hit.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not explicitly mention international support, the implication that some local sources (potentially sympathetic to Russia) are downplaying Ukrainian losses or hiding information subtly suggests a narrative of broader support or sympathy for Russia, even if indirectly. However, this is a weak match and may not fully fit the subnarrative. Given the lack of stronger evidence, this subnarrative is not confidently present."

Russian forces managed to advance from the recently captured ash dump and take control of the facilities on the northern outskirts of the large Coke and Chemical Plant... The ongoing Russian operations in various directions from their stronghold in Krasnogorovka force the Ukrainian command to transfer additional reserves to the area in an attempt to replace those completely destroyed.",
      "reasoning": "The text portrays Russian military operations as strategically effective, methodical, and capable of forcing Ukrainian forces into defensive positions. This supports the parent narrative of praising Russia but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "The text describes Russian military advances and territorial gains, which indirectly supports the subnarrative by implying that such gains could be reversed or are unsustainable, fitting the speculative nature of predicting Russian losses of occupied territories."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests Ukrainian forces are being depleted and struggling to maintain defenses, which aligns with the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes but does not fit the specific subnarratives of Russian or Ukrainian army collapse or loss of occupied territories. It implies a broader speculative outcome of the conflict."

      "reasoning": "The focus on Western-supplied weapons (Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles) being targeted by Russian strikes suggests that the West is only providing Ukraine with weapons for its own strategic interests (e.g., weakening Russia) rather than genuinely caring about Ukraine's sovereignty or civilian welfare."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the German government and its actions, challenging its competence and integrity in handling climate-related decisions, which aligns with the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities."
    },

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "She and other activists say expanding the coal mine would contribute to the climate crisis and be counterproductive to Germany’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "reasoning": "This statement questions the effectiveness and motives behind Germany's climate policies, specifically the approval of coal expansion projects, which contradicts its greenhouse gas reduction commitments."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Interactions between the activists and police have grown violent at times, resulting in the hospitalizations of at least nine demonstrators.",
      "reasoning": "While not a direct criticism, the mention of violence and hospitalizations during protests subtly challenges the impact and methods of the climate movement, implying potential negative consequences of their actions."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the German government's actions and decisions, specifically in the context of climate change and the coal mine expansion, aligning with the definition of disapproving national governments' handling of climate change."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "the Garzweiler coal mine, owned by European energy giant RWE, can expand.",
      "reasoning": "While not explicitly naming political figures, the criticism of RWE—a major energy corporation with close ties to political decision-making—implies disapproval of the political and economic structures enabling the coal expansion, fitting the subnarrative of discrediting political organizations in the climate debate."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Police told the BBC they arrested Thunberg and others after they “rushed towards the ledge” of the mine. All will be released without charges after their identities are checked, police said.",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text criticizes law enforcement's handling of the protest, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives. It highlights distrust in the authorities' actions during the climate protest."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "She and other activists say expanding the coal mine would contribute to the climate crisis and be counterproductive to Germany’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The country has pledged to phase out coal power generation by 2030, but it also recently approved coal expansion projects, saying they’re necessary to maintain the country’s energy security as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to disrupt oil and gas supplies.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights the contradiction in Germany's climate policies, suggesting that the approval of coal expansion projects undermines the country's stated goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This implies that the policies are ineffective in achieving their intended environmental outcomes."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The country has pledged to phase out coal power generation by 2030, but it also recently approved coal expansion projects, saying they’re necessary to maintain the country’s energy security as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to disrupt oil and gas supplies.",
      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that Germany's climate policies, such as phasing out coal, are being compromised due to economic and energy security concerns, implying that strict adherence to climate policies could have negative economic impacts."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Video captured at the protest showed three officers carrying a seemingly unbothered Thunberg, 20, away from the demonstration",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'seemingly unbothered' is a subtle ad hominem attack, implying Thunberg is indifferent or insincere about the protest, which undermines her reputation as a key activist."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Interactions between the activists and police have grown violent at times, resulting in the hospitalizations of at least nine demonstrators.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by portraying the climate movement's actions as disruptive and harmful, but it does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives. It implies the movement is responsible for escalating tensions, which is a form of criticism."

      "evidence_quote": "As Ukraine endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion, the impact extends far beyond the physical destruction of its cities and the displacement of its people.",
      "reasoning": "While the text explicitly mentions 'Russia's full-scale invasion,' the focus is primarily on the consequences for Ukraine rather than directly attributing blame to Russia for starting the war. However, the broader context of the article does not shift blame away from Russia, so this narrative is not strongly present. The quote is neutral in this regard, but the overall framing of the article does not engage in blame-shifting."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "This crisis in healthcare is set against a backdrop of long-standing distrust in mental health services in Ukraine, a legacy of the Soviet era when the psychiatric system was used to oppress dissidents and enemies of the state. A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights systemic issues within Ukraine's mental health services, portraying them as historically flawed and distrusted. While this is a factual observation, it could be interpreted as undermining Ukraine's ability to address its current crisis, aligning with the narrative of discrediting Ukraine."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "N/A",
      "reasoning": "There are no statements in the text that portray Russia as a victim or unfairly targeted. The focus is entirely on the consequences of Russia's invasion for Ukraine."

      "evidence_quote": "The full-scale invasion has magnified Ukraine's pre-existing challenges and introduced larger societal issues. The collective impact of population displacement, healthcare infrastructure destruction, and economic hardships contributes significantly to the deteriorating mental health of the society. Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",
      "reasoning": "This quote emphasizes the severe and ongoing psychological impact of the war on Ukrainians, evoking fear and anxiety about the future. It aligns with the narrative of amplifying war-related fears by highlighting the uncertainty and long-term consequences of the conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "Nonetheless, Ukrainian resilience knows no limits, and the people will endure whatever it takes for the cause of victory, as the sacrifices being made are endless for its people.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly blame the West, the framing of Ukrainian suffering as a result of an unspecified 'cause of victory' subtly shifts focus away from Russia's invasion. The emphasis on Ukrainian endurance and sacrifice without directly naming Russia as the aggressor could imply external forces (e.g., Western involvement) are prolonging the conflict, aligning with the subnarrative of deflecting blame from the invader."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The ongoing war in Ukraine has also significantly impacted the nation's healthcare infrastructure... In 2022, there were 707 documented attacks on Ukrainian health care facilities, resulting in significant destruction of or damage to 218 hospitals and clinics...",
      "reasoning": "The text extensively details the consequences of the war on Ukraine (e.g., mental health crisis, healthcare destruction, economic hardship) without explicitly attributing these outcomes to Russia's invasion in every instance. This omission subtly supports the parent narrative by focusing on the effects rather than the aggressor, leaving room for alternative interpretations of responsibility."

      "evidence_quote": "The full-scale invasion has magnified Ukraine's pre-existing challenges and introduced larger societal issues. The collective impact of population displacement, healthcare infrastructure destruction, and economic hardships contributes significantly to the deteriorating mental health of the society. Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly portrays Ukraine as facing insurmountable challenges with no clear resolution, emphasizing the lack of a positive future outlook. It aligns with the definition of the subnarrative by suggesting that the situation is dire and without hope."

The challenges within Ukraine extend beyond physical dangers. Financial hardships are widespread, with 78% reporting reduced incomes and a third losing jobs due to the war... government aid doesn’t help much.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the Ukrainian government's financial aid programs as insufficient and ineffective, directly undermining the government's competence and policies. It fits the subnarrative definition by portraying the government as incapable of addressing the needs of its citizens."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The impact of the war extends beyond physical damage, as it profoundly traumatizes Ukrainian society and threatens to affect future generations. The destruction of infrastructure and economic downturn complicates access to quality mental health services, a critical issue as the country grapples with the widespread societal trauma caused by the war. A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by highlighting systemic failures in mental health infrastructure and societal trauma, it does not neatly fit any of the specific subnarratives. It emphasizes long-standing issues and distrust in institutions, which contributes to the broader discrediting of Ukraine but is not covered by the predefined subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "As Ukraine endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion, the impact extends far beyond the physical destruction of its cities and the displacement of its people.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'Russia's full-scale invasion' is framed as an enduring action that Ukraine is passively suffering from, subtly implying that Russia is the aggressor without explicitly justifying its actions. However, the absence of any mention of Russian motivations or claims of self-defence in the text does not directly support this subnarrative. Thus, this subnarrative is not strongly present. Re-evaluating for other subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "The mental toll of Russia's invasion on Ukrainians is profound... Russia’s war against Ukraine has led to significant territorial occupation, destruction of homes, and one of the largest migration crises this century.",
      "reasoning": "The text consistently portrays Russia as the sole aggressor responsible for Ukraine's suffering, which aligns with the parent narrative 'Russia is the Victim' only in the sense that it could be used to argue that Western criticism of Russia is disproportionate or ignores Ukraine's complexities. However, the text does not explicitly claim Western russophobia or justify Russian actions as self-defence. Instead, it focuses on the consequences of the war for Ukrainians, which indirectly supports the parent narrative by framing Russia as the perpetrator of a crisis without contextualizing its motivations. This does not fit any specific subnarrative but supports the parent narrative in a broader sense."

A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not directly discredit Western or Ukrainian media, it supports the parent narrative of 'Distrust towards Media' by implying systemic distrust in Ukrainian institutions (e.g., mental health services) due to historical misuse. This fosters a broader atmosphere of skepticism toward official narratives, aligning with the parent narrative but not fitting the specific subnarratives provided. Thus, it qualifies for 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "The text emphasizes the scale and devastation of Russia's invasion, implicitly suggesting that Russia's aggressive actions could extend beyond Ukraine, aligning with the subnarrative that Russia may attack other countries."

It evokes a sense of hopelessness and prolonged suffering, which contributes to war-related fears."

      "reasoning": "This quote minimizes the significance of heat-related deaths and climate change impacts by emphasizing that cold-related deaths are more prevalent, thereby downplaying the urgency of climate change concerns."

      "reasoning": "The quote emphasizes that cold-related deaths far outnumber heat-related deaths, implying that the temperature increase does not have a significant negative impact on mortality rates, thus downplaying the severity of climate change effects."

      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that while there is a slight increase in heat-related deaths, the overall trend shows a greater decrease in cold-related deaths, implying that humans are adapting to temperature changes and mitigating their impact."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the claim that heat-related deaths are a significant issue, supporting the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but not fitting neatly into any of the specific subnarratives beyond undermining the urgency of heat-related threats."

      "evidence_quote": "According to the Lancet, people around the world are 9.4 times more likely to die from the cold than from the heat. It added that over the past 20 years, the death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the impact of temperature increases (global warming) is minimal compared to cold-related deaths, suggesting that the data does not support a significant or alarming temperature increase."

      "reasoning": "While this quote is part of the broader narrative questioning the science behind climate change claims, it does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by implying exaggeration or misrepresentation of risks without directly addressing methodologies, data, or the scientific community."

      "reasoning": "The headline and subsequent text frame the climate movement as exaggerating the severity of heat-related risks by using the term 'alarmists,' which directly suggests the movement is overstating threats for dramatic effect."

Last March, the Pew Research Center reported that 'few Republicans see climate change as a top priority for the country. Just 12% of Republicans and Republican leaners say dealing with climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress.' By contrast, 59 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress and an even larger majority (78 percent) views it as a major threat to the U.S., Pew found.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes political organizations and figures by highlighting partisan divides in climate change perception, implying that Democratic-leaning groups and figures exaggerate the threat of climate change for political gain or ideological reasons."

      "evidence_quote": "The UK-based Lancet medical journal, which regularly laments the dire consequences of climate change, published a study in 2021, which found that 5,083,173 deaths worldwide were associated with 'non-optimal temperatures per year,' and then went on to explain that the vast majority of these were 'cold-related' rather than 'heat-related.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the Lancet, an international entity, for allegedly exaggerating the risks of heat-related deaths while downplaying the more significant issue of cold-related deaths, suggesting bias or misrepresentation in its climate change narrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the EPA and the broader scientific or institutional narrative on climate change by challenging the accuracy of claims about heat-related deaths. While it targets a national institution (EPA), it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, thus qualifying for 'Other.'"

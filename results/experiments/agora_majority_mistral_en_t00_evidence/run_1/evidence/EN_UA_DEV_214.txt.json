So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly shifts blame for the war in Ukraine away from Russia (the invader) and toward China, implying China is responsible for enabling the conflict rather than acknowledging Russia's role as the aggressor."

      "reasoning": "The quote evokes fear by explicitly suggesting that NATO's actions are leading to a third world war, which aligns with the narrative of amplifying war-related fears."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the war away from Russia (the invader) and toward the West and China, portraying the West as the primary aggressor by framing its military support for Ukraine as the root cause of the conflict. It also dismisses Western narratives about China's role, reinforcing the subnarrative that the West is responsible for escalation."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the U.S. and its allies for expanding the conflict beyond Ukraine, implying they are the true aggressors in a broader, globalized war. While it aligns with the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West as direct aggressors in the Ukraine conflict, hence it is classified as 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by discrediting NATO and the West as aggressive and expansionist, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided.

      "reasoning": "While this quote does not directly target media institutions, it supports the parent narrative of distrust by implying that Western actions (including media narratives) are part of a broader, manipulative agenda to globalize war.

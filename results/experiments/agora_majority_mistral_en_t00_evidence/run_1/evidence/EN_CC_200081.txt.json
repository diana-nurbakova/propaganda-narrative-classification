    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes the effectiveness and environmental trade-offs of climate policies, specifically the felling of trees for wind farms, implying that the policy may not be as 'green' as claimed."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP)... Gougeon claimed that many of the trees would have been ‘replanted on-site’ and that the majority were expected to be cut down for commercial uses, regardless.",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the competence and integrity of the Scottish government by framing their actions as hypocritical and dismissive of environmental concerns, particularly their justification for tree felling."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people.",
      "reasoning": "The quote expresses skepticism and criticism of wind turbines, a green technology, by highlighting their environmental and social costs, such as deforestation, wildlife harm, and unethical mining practices."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms... sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote challenges the motives and impact of the climate movement by suggesting that its policies (e.g., wind farms) are harmful and out of touch with public and environmental concerns."
    }

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights multiple unintended negative environmental consequences of wind farm policies, such as deforestation, harm to wildlife, and reliance on environmentally damaging mining practices. This suggests the policies are not achieving their intended environmental goals effectively."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "Mr Kerr said: 'Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,' adding that the government 'must be alive' to the 'significant costs' of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly references the 'significant costs' of wind turbine installation, implying economic burdens associated with climate policies. Additionally, concerns about damage to wildlife and business further suggest negative economic impacts on rural communities."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies, it does not neatly fit into the predefined subnarratives. It focuses on broader social and community concerns (visual impact, wildlife, and business damage) that are not explicitly covered by the other subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the Scottish government's actions and policies regarding climate change initiatives, specifically the felling of trees for wind farms, which aligns with the definition of disapproving national governments' handling of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The Rural Affairs Secretary for the leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), Mairi Gougeon, has admitted that some 15.7 million trees were cut down since the year 2000...",
      "reasoning": "This quote discredits the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) and its political figure, Mairi Gougeon, by highlighting their role in the controversial tree-felling policy, fitting the subnarrative of criticizing political organizations and figures in the climate change debate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Nevertheless, the Scottish government has vowed to continue its 'green energy' push... Renewable energy generated from wind farms is a key element in Scotland’s response to the climate emergency and the shift towards net zero...",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided. It criticizes the Scottish government's continued commitment to wind energy despite the highlighted issues, which is a broader critique not covered by the other subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly highlights the dangers associated with renewable energy (wind turbines), including environmental harm to wildlife and severe health consequences for humans due to mining rare earth minerals. This aligns with the definition of the subnarrative 'Renewable energy is dangerous'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "the government 'must be alive' to the 'significant costs' of the installation of massive wind turbines... sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote emphasizes the 'significant costs' of wind turbine installation and broader economic concerns, which aligns with the subnarrative 'Renewable energy is costly'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms... Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the environmental trade-offs of wind farms (deforestation), but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives of 'dangerous', 'unreliable', or 'costly'. Thus, it qualifies for 'Other'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'supposedly ‘green energy’’ suggests skepticism about the climate movement's claims, implying that the environmental benefits are exaggerated or misleading, which aligns with the definition of the climate movement being alarmist."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms... sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business. Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the practical outcomes of the climate movement's policies (e.g., environmental damage, impact on wildlife, and business) but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by highlighting negative consequences without directly attacking activists or alleging corruption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China. The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This argument critiques the climate movement's solutions by pointing out the harmful side effects of wind turbine production (e.g., human rights abuses and environmental damage in mining). While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

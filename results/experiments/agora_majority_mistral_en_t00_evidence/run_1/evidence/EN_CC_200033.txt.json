      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism... The only solution to this state of emergency is for rich countries to immediately abandon economic expansion as a social goal.",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the motives and integrity of Greta Thunberg and the broader climate movement, framing their goals as radical and anti-capitalist rather than purely environmental. It aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement by questioning its true intentions."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a 'scam' which facilitates 'greenwashing, lying and cheating'.",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the integrity and intentions of the COP (Conference of the Parties) institution, framing it as dishonest and ineffective, which aligns with the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests a hidden agenda by the climate movement to dismantle Western systems and replace them with a totalitarian regime, implying a secret scheme by powerful groups, even if not explicitly named."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "EVs pollute 1850 times more than Fossil Fuel cars according to new study",

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Thunberg made the extremist comments during an appearance on Sunday night at London’s Royal Festival Hall to promote her new ‘Climate Book’. Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly describes Greta Thunberg as an 'alarm bell' and 'climate Cassandra,' suggesting that her role is to exaggerate or dramatize the severity of climate change for effect, which aligns with the definition of the subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto.",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'demented manifesto' is a direct attack on Greta Thunberg's character and reputation, rather than addressing the substance of her arguments, fitting the definition of an ad hominem attack."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a 'scam' which facilitates 'greenwashing, lying and cheating'. Only overthrow of 'the whole capitalist system' will suffice.",
      "reasoning": "The text alleges that the climate movement (via COP) is engaged in 'greenwashing, lying and cheating,' implying unethical practices and ulterior motives, which aligns with the subnarrative of corruption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format. The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion... admitted in his own words that his movement 'isn’t about the climate.'",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text supports the parent narrative by suggesting the climate movement has hidden political agendas (radical leftism) but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative categories, thus qualifying for 'Other.'"
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Greta Thunberg has gone fully mask off and is now calling for the overthrow of 'the whole capitalist system.'... Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra. Her role was to warn, not to instruct: her most viral moments involved her scolding political leaders, not trying to supplant them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Greta Thunberg, a prominent political figure in the climate debate, by portraying her shift from a neutral 'alarm bell' to a radical political actor seeking to overthrow systems. This aligns with the subnarrative of discrediting political figures in the context of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a 'scam' which facilitates 'greenwashing, lying and cheating'.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes COP, an international entity involved in climate policy, by labeling it a 'scam' and accusing it of enabling dishonesty. This fits the subnarrative of criticizing the role and influence of international entities on climate policy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of the EU",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly mention the EU, the broader implication that climate policies (often associated with the EU's regulatory framework) are a guise for radical leftism can be interpreted as criticism of the EU's role in climate change. This is a stretch but aligns with the subnarrative's definition of disapproval of the EU's approach."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion... admitted in his own words that his movement 'isn’t about the climate.'... Basden asserted that whatever climate problems exist can’t be fixed and that the movement should instead be focused on tearing down the entire system of western capitalism... So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text criticizes environmental movements and their alleged hidden agendas, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities but does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives. It broadly discredits activist groups and their motives, warranting the use of 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "The climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the climate movement is a covert operation to promote a hidden radical leftist agenda, implying a secret scheme by powerful groups to manipulate public perception and policy."

      "evidence_quote": "the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion... admitted in his own words that his movement 'isn’t about the climate.'... the true goals of the far-left environmentalist action group... tearing down the entire system of western capitalism",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly claims that environmental movements are a front for a hidden agenda to dismantle capitalism, implying a secret plot by powerful groups to deceive the public and advance their ideological goals."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the climate movement as a covert effort to impose a totalitarian system, suggesting a hidden plot by powerful groups to overthrow Western values and institutions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "EVs pollute 1850 times more than Fossil Fuel cars according to new study",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the environmental benefits of electric vehicles (EVs), a key green technology, by asserting they are more polluting than fossil fuel cars. While it does not fit the predefined subnarratives exactly, it supports the parent narrative by casting doubt on the efficacy of green technologies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is unreliable",
      "evidence_quote": "The climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format... the movement should instead be focused on tearing down the entire system of western capitalism (China, the world’s biggest polluter, isn’t mentioned once).",
      "reasoning": "While not explicitly about renewable energy reliability, the text undermines the credibility of climate activism and its associated green technologies by framing them as politically motivated rather than scientifically sound. This indirectly suggests that the solutions proposed (e.g., renewable energy) are unreliable because they are part of a flawed ideological agenda."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "The only solution to this state of emergency is for rich countries to immediately abandon economic expansion as a social goal.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that adopting green technologies or policies would require sacrificing economic growth, framing them as prohibitively costly and inefficient for widespread adoption."

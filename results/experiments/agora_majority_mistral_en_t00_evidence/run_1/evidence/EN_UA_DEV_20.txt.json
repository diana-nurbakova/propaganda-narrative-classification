      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia by suggesting that the UK and US are responsible for sabotaging a potential peace deal, thereby prolonging the conflict."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv. The Ukrainians have, so far, been able to prevent the Russians from advancing and seizing all the territory that Moscow now claims. But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's military capabilities and portrays its forces as weak and unsustainable, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the continuation of the war onto the U.S. and U.K., portraying them as the ones who sabotaged a potential peace deal, thereby framing the West as the aggressors prolonging the conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the Ukrainian government and its Western backers for escalating the conflict, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It reinforces the idea that the war is being prolonged by external actors rather than the invader (Russia)."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained. Recently, the Russians even launched a brand new incursion into territory around the northeastern city of Kharkiv—territory that had already been recaptured by the Ukrainians in late 2022. Russia’s minefields, artillery, and punishing glide bombs have not only kept Ukrainian forces from advancing but left them struggling to hold their positions along the current front line.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian military by highlighting its failures in the counteroffensive, loss of territory, and inability to hold positions against Russian forces."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law that sought to boost conscription rates by making it easier for the government to find and identify draft-eligible men. But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays the Ukrainian government as desperate and heavy-handed in its policies, particularly in conscription efforts, which delegitimizes its leadership and decision-making."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly suggests that Ukraine is not acting independently but is instead being controlled or heavily influenced by Western powers (the UK and US), aligning with the subnarrative definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv. The Ukrainians have, so far, been able to prevent the Russians from advancing and seizing all the territory that Moscow now claims. But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Ukraine’s military situation as unsustainable and without viable prospects for a positive outcome, fitting the definition of the subnarrative that Ukraine’s situation is hopeless."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What makes Ukraine’s situation even more tragic is how easily it could have been avoided. One month after Russia invaded in early 2022, both sides reached an agreement where Russia would pull back to preinvasion boundaries and, in return, Ukraine would agree to not seek NATO membership. The deal could have put an end to the fighting and handed Kyiv control of all the land Russia had just seized.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by implying that Ukraine’s leadership made poor decisions (walking away from a potential deal) that worsened the country’s situation, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided. Thus, it qualifies for 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly accuses the West of escalating the conflict unnecessarily and engaging in 'strategically pointless provocations,' which aligns with the definition of portraying the West as reacting disproportionately to Russia's actions."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the U.S. and U.K. prioritized their own strategic interests (e.g., weakening Russia) over Ukraine's potential to secure a favorable peace deal, implying they do not genuinely care about Ukraine's fate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "Since then, Ukraine’s leverage over Russia has only diminished... So, accepting Russia’s offer to move this conflict from the battlefield to the negotiation table is almost certainly the best chance Ukraine will get to hold onto the eastern territory they still control. But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict...",
      "reasoning": "The text argues that diplomacy (negotiating with Russia) was a viable and preferable option, but the West rejected it in favor of continued conflict, thereby discrediting the potential of diplomatic efforts."

      "evidence_quote": "Russia’s minefields, artillery, and punishing glide bombs have not only kept Ukrainian forces from advancing but left them struggling to hold their positions along the current front line. Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This passage undermines the West's military and industrial support for Ukraine by highlighting Russia's superior war production and battlefield effectiveness, which supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West but does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western sanctions or support strategies have failed to weaken Russia and instead allowed Russia to strengthen its military production, implying that Western actions are counterproductive and will have negative consequences for the West."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by highlighting the broader negative consequences of Western involvement in the conflict, such as increased global instability and the risk of nuclear escalation, which do not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives but still emphasize harm to the West."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden then renewed one of his favorite tropes, asserting that if Ukraine falls, its people will be subjugated, its neighbors will be in immediate danger, and all of Europe will be threatened by Putin’s aggressive ambitions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote claims that Russia's aggression will not stop at Ukraine and that neighboring countries and all of Europe are at imminent risk, directly matching the subnarrative's definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "the US then test-fired two nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles... The escalations have not been one-sided. Russia conducted drills simulating the use of strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus... nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "These quotes highlight the risk of nuclear escalation, including drills and missile tests, which evoke fear of nuclear weapons being employed, fitting the subnarrative's definition."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title explicitly frames the wind energy initiative as a 'ripoff,' which directly questions the effectiveness or economic impact of climate policies, aligning with the definition of criticizing climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'ripoff' in the title suggests skepticism or criticism of wind energy as a green technology, implying it may not be a viable or cost-effective solution."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff… WASHINGTON — The Department of the Interior today announced results from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s wind energy auction...",
      "reasoning": "The framing of the announcement as a 'ripoff' challenges the competence or integrity of the Department of the Interior and the Biden-Harris administration, which falls under criticism of institutions and authorities."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff… The lease sale represents the third major offshore wind lease sale this year and the first ever for the Pacific region. Today’s sale drew competitive high bids from 5 companies totaling $757.1 million, well exceeding the first lease sales that were held in the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff' and the emphasis on the high monetary value of the bids ($757.1 million) imply that the climate policies are driven by financial gain for corporations rather than genuine environmental concerns. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies are only for profit."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'ripoff' suggests that the policy is perceived as economically wasteful or harmful, implying a negative economic impact. This supports the subnarrative that climate policies harm the economy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The overarching tone of the title and the framing of the wind energy auction as a 'ripoff' does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but still clearly criticizes climate policies. This residual criticism supports the parent narrative without fitting a specific subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "The lease sale represents the third major offshore wind lease sale this year and the first ever for the Pacific region. Today’s sale drew competitive high bids from 5 companies totaling $757.1 million, well exceeding the first lease sales that were held in the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the high financial cost of the offshore wind lease sale, implying that renewable energy projects require significant investment, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title of the text itself frames the offshore wind energy initiative as a 'ripoff,' suggesting a broader critique of green technologies that does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives but still supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title itself, 'The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff,' directly criticizes the national government's (U.S.) handling of the wind energy initiative, framing it as a negative or wasteful endeavor. This aligns with the subnarrative of disapproving national governments' approach to climate change or related policies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The Biden-Harris administration believes that to address the climate crisis head on, we must unleash a new era of clean, reliable energy that serves every household in America.",
      "reasoning": "While the quote itself is neutral, the framing of the article's title ('The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff') and the dismissive tone toward the administration's initiative imply discrediting of the Biden-Harris administration in the context of climate policy. This supports the subnarrative of criticizing political figures and organizations."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The interest and success of today’s sale represents a significant milestone toward achieving President Biden’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 and 15 gigawatts of floating offshore wind capacity by 2035.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'significant milestone' is presented in a context where the overarching tone of the article (as suggested by the title) undermines the legitimacy or value of the initiative. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other.'"

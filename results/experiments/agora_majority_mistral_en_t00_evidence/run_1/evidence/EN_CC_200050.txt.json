      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act... the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid transition to renewables, aligning with the definition of criticizing climate policies by highlighting potential negative consequences."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks... submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies skepticism or criticism of the Federal Reserve's involvement in climate-related financial regulations, challenging the competence or intentions of a key institution."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Deutsche bank in particular drew some criticism from activist groups that considered the move to be insufficient, since it did not include similar cutbacks in oil and gas... Activist groups had previously hailed the decision from major British bank HSBC in December to not fund new oil and gas investments...",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights perceived inconsistencies or overreach in the demands of climate activist groups, challenging their motives or impact, which fits the definition of criticizing the climate movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy... The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "While not explicit, the emphasis on banks aligning with global initiatives like the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance and shifting investments toward green energy can imply that these policies are being used as tools for broader geopolitical influence rather than purely environmental concerns."

      "evidence_quote": "(RELATED: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Shatter Record Despite Green Investments)",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly suggests that despite significant green investments, carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise, implying that climate policies (such as green investments) are not achieving their intended environmental goals."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This statement highlights the economic challenges and potential negative impacts of transitioning away from fossil fuels too quickly, particularly for developing nations, which aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies may harm economic stability."

Activist groups had previously hailed the decision from major British bank HSBC in December to not fund new oil and gas investments and move to overhaul existing businesses it finances, joining fellow British bank Lloyds.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by implying that climate policies (e.g., bank investment restrictions) are either inconsistent or driven by external pressures rather than clear, effective strategies. However, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Both banks are founding members of the United Nations’ Net Zero Banking Alliance, which requires its 126 members to set goals and disclose financial data related to their efforts to reduce the emissions of their lending portfolio to net zero by 2050.",
      "reasoning": "The text implicitly criticizes the influence of the United Nations (an international entity) by framing its Net Zero Banking Alliance as a coercive or misguided force driving banks to adopt climate policies, which may be seen as overreach or ineffective."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes a political figure (Brad Lander) for pressuring banks to adopt climate-related policies, portraying this as an overreach of political influence in financial institutions."

      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the U.S. Federal Reserve (a national government institution) for imposing regulatory requirements on banks, suggesting government overreach in climate policy enforcement."

      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021... The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, it supports the parent narrative by implying that banks are being pressured or misled into prioritizing green energy investments over fossil fuels, which could be seen as a broader critique of institutional decision-making."

      "evidence_quote": "Activist groups had previously hailed the decision from major British bank HSBC in December to not fund new oil and gas investments and move to overhaul existing businesses it finances, joining fellow British bank Lloyds.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies that activist groups are pushing for extreme measures (e.g., cutting all oil and gas investments) without considering practical or transitional challenges, which aligns with the subnarrative that the climate movement exaggerates the urgency or feasibility of its demands."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Deutsche bank in particular drew some criticism from activist groups that considered the move to be insufficient, since it did not include similar cutbacks in oil and gas... U.S. banks... have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights that activist groups are never satisfied with incremental progress and continually demand more aggressive actions, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives. This suggests a pattern of relentless pressure that could be seen as unreasonable or counterproductive."

      "evidence_quote": "the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that developed nations (e.g., those represented by major banks) are pushing green policies that may disproportionately affect developing nations, which lack the resources to transition quickly. This aligns with the neo-colonialism subnarrative, as it suggests an imposition of policies that could limit the economic sovereignty of developing countries."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting regulatory pressure from institutions like the Federal Reserve to enforce green policies, which could be seen as a form of geopolitical leverage. However, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of exploitative relations or neo-colonialism, warranting its classification under 'Other'."

U.S. banks... have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios.",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text critiques the broader push for green technologies by highlighting the controversy and pressure from activist groups, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions."

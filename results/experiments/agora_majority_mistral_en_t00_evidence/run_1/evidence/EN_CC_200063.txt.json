    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The SEC must stop overreaching in this area and allow private ordering under corporate law to reestablish shareholder proposals as ways to enhance economic efficiency rather than diminish it.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the SEC's regulatory approach to shareholder proposals related to climate change, arguing that it diminishes economic efficiency. This directly questions the effectiveness and economic impact of climate policies, fitting the definition of 'Criticism of climate policies'."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the competence and integrity of the SEC, an institution, by describing its regulatory approach as 'arguably lawless'. This aligns with the definition of 'Criticism of institutions and authorities'."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The shareholder proposal process has gone too far. How else to interpret the proposal recently sponsored by the climate activist investors Arjuna Capital and Follow This at ExxonMobil, which called on the oil giant to reduce further its carbon footprint?",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the motives and impact of climate activist investors (part of the climate movement), implying their actions are excessive or misguided. This fits the definition of 'Criticism of climate movement'."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the proposed emission reduction targets would force ExxonMobil to abandon significant business operations, indirectly criticizing the feasibility or economic viability of green technologies or transition strategies."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "The text suggests that climate-related shareholder proposals, driven by regulatory overreach, are ineffective in achieving meaningful outcomes, as they bypass corporate governance structures and do not align with economic efficiency."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly argues that implementing the climate proposal would force ExxonMobil to abandon significant economic investments and reduce operations, implying a negative economic impact."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The shareholder proposal process has gone too far... leaving unaltered for now the troubling manner in which the SEC oversees its shareholder-proposal process.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes climate-related shareholder proposals and the regulatory framework supporting them but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by implying that climate policies are disruptive to corporate governance without specifying ineffectiveness or economic harm."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the SEC (a political organization) for its regulatory approach, discrediting its role in the shareholder proposal process and framing it as overreaching and unlawful."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "We argue that the SEC must stop overreaching in this area and allow private ordering under corporate law to reestablish shareholder proposals as ways to enhance economic efficiency rather than diminish it.",
      "reasoning": "While this statement also criticizes the SEC, it goes beyond discrediting specific figures or organizations by broadly advocating for a systemic change in how the SEC operates, which does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "The text suggests that the climate movement's demands (e.g., reducing emissions by 50% by 2030) are unrealistic and overly aggressive, implying exaggeration or alarmism in their goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement's influence on regulatory processes, framing it as disruptive and outside the bounds of corporate law. While it supports the parent narrative (criticism of the climate movement), it does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly highlights the financial and operational costs associated with accelerating emission reductions, implying that the proposed green transition is economically burdensome and thus aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy (or green transitions) is costly."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the regulatory framework supporting green initiatives (shareholder proposals on emissions) but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by framing green technology advocacy as overreach or misguided, without directly addressing cost, reliability, or danger."

      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,” said Irish MEP Clare Daly.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto the West, implying that the West is responsible for the conflict's persistence by vetoing a peace agreement."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,” said Irish MEP Clare Daly. “And you have the audacity to claim that this is assistance to Ukraine. The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies. Don’t expect the citizens of the EU to support you in this; you speak like crazed maniacs.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes Western diplomacy and policies, portraying them as hypocritical, self-serving, and irrational. It undermines the legitimacy of Western support for Ukraine by suggesting it is driven by corporate interests rather than humanitarian or strategic concerns."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "“We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,” the politician said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote predicts severe negative consequences for Western Europe, framing it as a potential target of retaliation if the West continues its support for Ukraine. It implies that Western actions will lead to catastrophic outcomes."

      "evidence_quote": "He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a “US problem.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement speculates about the outcome of the war, asserting that the EU cannot win against Russia and framing the conflict as a problem solely for the U.S. It makes assumptions about the future trajectory of the war without evidence."

      "reasoning": "This quote amplifies fear by suggesting that continued Western support for Ukraine could lead to a catastrophic conflict where Slavic nations unite to destroy Western Europe. It evokes anxiety about escalation and retaliation."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly accuses the West (and the U.S. in particular) of instigating and prolonging the war as a proxy conflict to damage Russia, thereby shifting responsibility away from the invader (Russia)."

      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West as aggressors, it supports the parent narrative by framing the West as the instigator of a conflict that pits Slavs against each other, thereby deflecting blame from Russia."

      "evidence_quote": "He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a 'US problem.'",

      "evidence_quote": "Members of the European Parliament (EP) engaged in mutual insults during debates on the need for further support to Ukraine. Several European Parliamentarians accused advocates of continuing military assistance of madness and called for an end to arms shipments during debates in the EP’s plenary session in Strasbourg.",

      "evidence_quote": "We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly claims that Western support for Ukraine is motivated by self-interest (damaging Russia) rather than genuine concern for Ukraine's fate, aligning with the subnarrative definition."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying the West as provocative and escalatory, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It introduces a threat of retaliation, which is distinct from the provided definitions."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "“We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly warns of catastrophic consequences for Western Europe (a key part of the West) if it continues its current policy of supporting Ukraine, framing it as a direct backlash that will lead to destruction. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western actions (e.g., sanctions or military support) will have severe negative repercussions for the West itself."

      "evidence_quote": "“We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,”",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by emphasizing financial and strategic harm to the West (EU taxpayers) due to its involvement in the conflict. While it highlights negative consequences, it does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'sanctions backfiring' or 'refugee flows,' thus qualifying for 'Other.'"

      "evidence_quote": "He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a 'US problem.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that the Russian position is strong and that the EU cannot defeat Russia, which indirectly suggests that Ukraine (backed by the EU/US) will not regain the occupied territories. This aligns with speculative outcomes about the war, framing Russia as unlikely to lose control of the territories it occupies."

      "reasoning": "This statement speculates about geopolitical outcomes and escalation (e.g., Slavic unity against Western Europe) but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes by introducing a hypothetical, extreme consequence of continued conflict."

The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies. Don’t expect the citizens of the EU to support you in this; you speak like crazed maniacs.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by framing continued support for Ukraine as irrational and dangerous ('crazed maniacs'), implying that it will lead to further harm to EU citizens, but it does not fit the specific subnarratives of imminent nuclear use, NATO intervention, or direct claims of Russia attacking other countries."

      "evidence_quote": "“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote amplifies fear by suggesting that continued involvement in the war will lead to the destruction of Ukraine and waste of EU resources, but it does not align with the specific subnarratives provided."

      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that Russia's actions in Ukraine were a response to Western interference, framing them as a defensive measure rather than an aggressive act. The claim that the war could have been stopped if the West had not vetoed a peace agreement suggests that Russia was willing to negotiate, and the conflict is the West's fault."

      "evidence_quote": "“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote accuses the West of deliberately fueling the war to harm Russia, portraying Western actions as driven by a negative and hostile perspective toward Russia (russophobia) rather than legitimate concerns about Ukraine's sovereignty."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by framing the conflict as a Western-driven aggression against Slavic unity, implying that Russia is a victim of Western divisiveness. However, it does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives, as it focuses on ethnic solidarity and threats rather than direct justifications for Russia's actions or claims of extremism in Ukraine."

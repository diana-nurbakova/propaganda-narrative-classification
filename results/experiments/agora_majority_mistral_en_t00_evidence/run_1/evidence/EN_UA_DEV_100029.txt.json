      "evidence_quote": "the Ukrainian troops are 'capable and trained.'",
      "reasoning": "While this quote itself is positive about Ukraine, the broader context of the text focuses on Russian military failures and Ukrainian resilience, which could be interpreted as a counter-narrative. However, no direct discrediting of Ukraine is present in the given text, so this narrative does not apply. (Note: This entry is included to clarify that no discrediting of Ukraine occurs here, but it does not fit the required schema for a valid narrative in this case.)"

      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "",
      "reasoning": "There are no statements in the text that positively highlight Russia’s actions, policies, or character. Instead, the text focuses on Russian military failures and weaknesses."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "",
      "reasoning": "The text does not criticize Western countries, leaders, or policies. It highlights Western support for Ukraine but does not discredit diplomacy or the West."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "",
      "reasoning": "The text does not portray Russia as unfairly targeted or victimized. Instead, it describes Russia’s military struggles as a result of its own actions and leadership failures."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "",
      "reasoning": "The text does not shift blame for the war away from Russia. It explicitly attributes Russia’s military failures to its own leadership and strategic decisions."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "nine countries pledged to send over 150 Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The Group that met today discussed air defense, regular artillery, rocket artillery, armor, and ammunition contributions. That will be critical to Ukraine's ability to continue the fight",
      "reasoning": "This quote excessively highlights the contributions and support of Western countries to Ukraine, framing their actions as crucial and commendable. While it is factual, the emphasis on Western generosity and effectiveness aligns with the narrative of overpraising the West."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff noted that nine countries pledged to send over 150 Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The Group that met today discussed air defense, regular artillery, rocket artillery, armor, and ammunition contributions. 'That will be critical to Ukraine's ability to continue the fight,' Milley said, noting that long range fires would challenge Russia's ability to command and control, protect, and sustain their forces.",
      "reasoning": "This quote emphasizes Ukraine's reliance on Western military support and coordination, portraying Ukraine as dependent on Western powers for its defense capabilities. This aligns with the subnarrative that Ukraine is a puppet of the West, as it suggests Ukraine's military actions are heavily influenced or controlled by external forces."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Milley added that Ukrainian precision munitions continued to target the logistics and communication systems of Russians who lack effective small unit leaders and proper equipment.",
      "reasoning": "While this statement is framed as praise for Ukrainian military actions, it indirectly supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by highlighting Ukraine's military successes as contingent on Western-supplied precision munitions. This subtly reinforces the idea that Ukraine's military effectiveness is not self-sustaining, which aligns with the broader goal of undermining Ukraine's credibility but does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“Russia remains isolated. Their military stocks are rapidly depleting, the soldiers are demoralized, untrained, unmotivated, conscripts, and convicts, and their leadership is failing them, having already failed in their strategic objectives,”",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly praise Russia, it is included here under 'Other' because the parent narrative 'URW: Praise of Russia' is known to be present. However, the content of the text is actually critical of Russia's military and leadership, which does not align with any of the specific subnarratives of praise. Thus, the 'Other' category is used to acknowledge the parent narrative's presence despite the lack of direct praise."

      "evidence_quote": "“Russia remains isolated. Their military stocks are rapidly depleting, the soldiers are demoralized, untrained, unmotivated, conscripts, and convicts, and their leadership is failing them, having already failed in their strategic objectives,” Milley said... “It’s obvious to the world and it should be obvious to Putin that these objectives are no longer achievable by continuing this war,”",
      "reasoning": "The quote portrays Russia as militarily weak and strategically failing, which could be framed as the West exaggerating or overreacting to a perceived threat that is already collapsing. This aligns with the subnarrative that the West's response is disproportionate."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The Group that met today discussed air defense, regular artillery, rocket artillery, armor, and ammunition contributions. 'That will be critical to Ukraine's ability to continue the fight,' Milley said, noting that long range fires would challenge Russia's ability to command and control, protect, and sustain their forces.",
      "reasoning": "The emphasis on military contributions and their strategic value to weakening Russia's command and control suggests a focus on Western geopolitical interests (e.g., degrading Russian military capabilities) rather than purely humanitarian or Ukrainian-centric concerns. This supports the subnarrative that the West is prioritizing its own interests over Ukraine's fate."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "nine countries pledged to send over 150 Leopard tanks to Ukraine",
      "reasoning": "While this statement highlights Western support for Ukraine, it can also be interpreted as evidence of the West's collective effort to prolong the conflict for broader strategic goals (e.g., weakening Russia), which aligns with the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives. This is a remainder supporting the parent narrative."

      "evidence_quote": "It’s obvious to the world and it should be obvious to Putin that these objectives are no longer achievable by continuing this war",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly state that Russia's actions are self-defence, the implication that Russia's 'objectives are no longer achievable' subtly frames the war as a failed offensive rather than an unprovoked invasion, which aligns with the subnarrative that Russia's actions are justified or defensive in nature."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia remains isolated. Their military stocks are rapidly depleting, the soldiers are demoralized, untrained, unmotivated, conscripts, and convicts, and their leadership is failing them, having already failed in their strategic objectives",
      "reasoning": "The text portrays Russia as a victim of circumstance—isolated, with failing leadership, and forced into a war it cannot win. This supports the parent narrative that Russia is the victim but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided, as it focuses on Russia's perceived weaknesses rather than direct blame on the West, Ukraine, or extremism."

'That will be critical to Ukraine's ability to continue the fight,' Milley said, noting that long range fires would challenge Russia's ability to command and control, protect, and sustain their forces.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the West (via the Ukraine Defense Contact Group) is actively enabling and escalating the conflict by providing Ukraine with advanced military capabilities, which could be framed as the West being the aggressor rather than Russia. The focus on Western military support shifts attention away from Russia's invasion as the primary cause of the war."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia is increasingly relying on other countries such as Iran and North Korea, he noted.",
      "reasoning": "This statement subtly shifts blame by highlighting Russia's reliance on external actors (Iran and North Korea) for support, which could be interpreted as implying these countries are complicit in prolonging the war. While not directly blaming Ukraine or the West, it supports the parent narrative by deflecting sole responsibility away from Russia."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support",
      "evidence_quote": "The Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff noted that nine countries pledged to send over 150 Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The Group that met today discussed air defense, regular artillery, rocket artillery, armor, and ammunition contributions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote emphasizes the widespread backing for Western policies and actions by highlighting the contributions of multiple countries to Ukraine's defense efforts, which aligns with the subnarrative definition of claiming strong international support for the West."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s obvious to the world and it should be obvious to Putin that these objectives are no longer achievable by continuing this war.",
      "reasoning": "This statement portrays Western-aligned actions (supporting Ukraine) as morally superior and aligned with global consensus and justice, implying the West is on the 'right side of history.'"

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine holds back the Russian troops due to robust defenses... Ukrainian precision munitions continued to target the logistics and communication systems of Russians who lack effective small unit leaders and proper equipment.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by overpraising Western-backed Ukrainian forces and their effectiveness, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided. It reinforces the idea of Western superiority without explicitly claiming moral alignment, historical righteousness, or international support."

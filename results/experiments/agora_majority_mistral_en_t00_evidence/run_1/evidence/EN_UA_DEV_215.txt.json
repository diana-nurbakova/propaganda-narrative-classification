    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks Ukraine's legitimacy and integrity by emphasizing its corruption, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine. It undermines the moral standing of Ukraine by suggesting systemic corruption."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the responsibility for potential shifts in U.S. support for Ukraine lies with Ukraine's corruption and not Russia's invasion. It subtly shifts blame away from Russia by focusing on Ukraine's internal issues as a reason for waning Western support."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the reliability and integrity of Hersh's claims, which indirectly casts doubt on media narratives and sources, aligning with the definition of distrust towards media."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes U.S. government actions and policies, suggesting incompetence or mismanagement in handling aid to Ukraine, which aligns with discrediting the West and its diplomatic efforts."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly targets the Ukrainian government and its officials by portraying them as inherently corrupt, aligning with the subnarrative's definition of delegitimizing the government and its policies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities",
      "evidence_quote": "The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Ukraine is a center for fraud and illicit activities, particularly regarding the misuse of aid and weapons, which fits the subnarrative of portraying Ukraine as a hub for criminal activities."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by undermining support for Ukraine but does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It focuses on eroding public and political will to support Ukraine, which is a distinct argument not covered by the predefined subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts focus away from Russia's invasion by framing Western aid to Ukraine as a self-interested geopolitical maneuver, implying the West is driving the conflict rather than Russia being the aggressor. It subtly suggests the war is about Western ambitions rather than Russian aggression."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine. Earlier this year, it was his allegation that the U.S. was responsible for the undersea explosions targeting the Nord Stream II pipeline.",
      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative by highlighting claims that attribute responsibility for war-related actions (e.g., Nord Stream II sabotage) to the U.S., diverting blame from Russia. While not fitting a specific subnarrative, it reinforces the broader theme of shifting responsibility away from the invader."

      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The text discredits a Western journalist (Seymour Hersh) by claiming his reporting is 'Russian propaganda' and 'thinly sourced,' implying Western media is used to manipulate public opinion rather than provide objective reporting. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This thinly sourced statement, however, skims over the complexities of a very nuanced war. It is not a statement that can exist without a deeper explanation–and that explanation takes the wind out of the sails of a very damaging allegation.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes Hersh's reporting as oversimplified and misleading, suggesting that media narratives (even those from non-Western or alternative sources) are unreliable or manipulative. This supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives, hence the use of 'Other.'"

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly states that Western (specifically U.S.) support for Ukraine is not motivated by concern for Ukraine itself but by self-interested geopolitical calculations, aligning with the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western (American) public and political support for Ukraine is waning due to fatigue over corruption and financial burdens, directly matching the subnarrative definition."

      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase discredits Western media and investigative figures by associating them with Russian propaganda, supporting the parent narrative of discrediting the West but not fitting any specific subnarrative. It implies Western narratives are unreliable or manipulated."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "The statement directly criticizes the economic impact of climate policies, specifically targeting their role in increasing housing costs, which aligns with the definition of questioning the effectiveness and economic consequences of climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that 'lower greenhouse gas emissions' and fight the so-called 'climate crisis.'",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'so-called climate crisis' and the framing of the program as an imposition challenge the competence and intentions of the Biden administration and its institutions, fitting the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses skepticism and criticism of wind, solar, and biomass energy, directly aligning with the narrative of controversy about green technologies."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills. And these elevated prices for essentials factor into price increases for everything else.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that climate policies are causing financial hardship for average Americans, specifically mentioning unaffordable housing, rent, gasoline, and utility bills, which aligns with the definition of negative economic outcomes."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that renewable energy sources promoted by climate policies are inefficient, unable to meet energy demands, and environmentally destructive, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended goals."

      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that 'lower greenhouse gas emissions' and fight the so-called 'climate crisis.' More than half of this endowment will go to implementing a universal 'energy conservation code' that will compel homeowners to spend as much as $31,000 to renovate their homes to be in compliance with this directive.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies, it does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives. It highlights the imposition of costly regulations on homeowners, which is a distinct argument against climate policies but not explicitly about ineffectiveness, economic impact, or profit motives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American... Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that 'lower greenhouse gas emissions' and fight the so-called 'climate crisis.'... This additional spending for owners of houses and residential buildings comes at a period in the United States when families are already struggling to afford a home.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly criticizes the Biden administration and its Department of Energy for implementing policies that are portrayed as harmful to average Americans, particularly in making housing unaffordable. This directly aligns with the definition of criticizing national governments' handling of climate change."

To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted... The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent...",
      "reasoning": "The text discredits President Biden and his administration's policies, framing them as detrimental to the economic well-being of Americans. This fits the definition of criticizing political figures in the context of climate change debate."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "State and local governments that take advantage of the Biden administration's funding for implementing green building codes would further be spurred to eventually phase out the use of natural gas in homes and residential buildings – which could make energy costs even more expensive as cheap natural gas disappears.",
      "reasoning": "While the text primarily criticizes national policies and political figures, this quote extends the criticism to state and local governments' potential actions, which is not fully captured by the specific subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the predefined categories, warranting the use of 'Other'."

This additional spending for owners of houses and residential buildings comes at a period in the United States when families are already struggling to afford a home... Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes... could make energy costs even more expensive as cheap natural gas disappears.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly argues that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are more expensive and inefficient, leading to higher costs for housing, utilities, and other essentials. It also highlights the financial burden of compliance with green building codes, directly supporting the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations... 'Green energy' mining is polluting rivers and farmland at an unsustainable pace, leaving 23 million people exposed to toxic waste.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights environmental dangers associated with renewable energy, such as wind farms killing wildlife and green energy mining polluting rivers and farmland. This supports the subnarrative that renewable energy is dangerous."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "development of renewable energy sources like hydroelectric and nuclear power plants is also being slowed down, if not completely stopped... John Kerry admits NUCLEAR ENERGY is necessary but continues to push for wind and solar instead... IRONIC? Tesla is building the world's largest supercharger station, but it's powered by a diesel power plant.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the slowdown of hydroelectric and nuclear energy development, questions the prioritization of wind and solar over nuclear, and highlights the irony of a diesel-powered supercharger station. These points support the parent narrative but do not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "\"To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames the climate movement's goals as an 'alleged' crisis, suggesting exaggeration or dramatization of the severity of climate change, which aligns with the definition of the subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "These statements criticize the climate movement's policies by highlighting their perceived negative economic and practical consequences, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. The focus on economic hardship and inefficiency of renewable energy sources is distinct from the other defined subnarratives."

More than half of this endowment will go to implementing a universal 'energy conservation code' that will compel homeowners to spend as much as $31,000 to renovate their homes to be in compliance with this directive.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes the financial burden imposed on homeowners by green policies, framing them as economically abusive and coercive. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate-related international relations (or domestic policies framed as part of a global agenda) are exploitative."

      "evidence_quote": "'To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted,' wrote Ring for American Greatness, while at the same time pointing out that the development of renewable energy sources like hydroelectric and nuclear power plants is also being slowed down, if not completely stopped. Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation... 'The consequences of \"green\" policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,' wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text supports the parent narrative by arguing that green policies are part of a broader agenda that harms Americans economically and strategically (e.g., weakening the nation's ability to withstand military conflict). However, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'abusive/exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism,' thus qualifying for 'Other.'"

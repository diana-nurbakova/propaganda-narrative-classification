Instead the text implies the opposite: West is strong and united in support of Ukraine. The subnarrative that is more closely related is URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided is not mentioned. But the overall tone suggests a strong Western support. Hence we can classify the narrative as: URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",

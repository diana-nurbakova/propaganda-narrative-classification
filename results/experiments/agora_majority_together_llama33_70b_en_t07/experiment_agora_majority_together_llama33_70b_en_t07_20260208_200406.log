[graph] Fuzzy matched 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Rewriting Ukraine’s history' -> 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Rewriting Ukraineâ€™s history' (score: 96.4)
[graph] Fuzzy matched 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is not overreacting; URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests is not present; however URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work is not directly mentioned but URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak is also not present in the text. Instead the text implies the opposite: West is strong and united in support of Ukraine. The subnarrative that is more closely related is URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided is not mentioned. But the overall tone suggests a strong Western support. Hence we can classify the narrative as: URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other' -> 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work' (score: 100.0)

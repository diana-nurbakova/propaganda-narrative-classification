      "evidence_quote": "Ele é a favor da paz, a favor de terminar com o apoio que está a ser oferecido e só podemos elogiar esta postura porque é o que precisamos - parar de encher a Ucrânia com armas e, então, a guerra vai acabar",
      "reasoning": "The statement predicts that the war will end if arming of Ukraine stops, constituting a forecast about the conflict's outcome."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Agora, não há tal diálogo",
      "reasoning": "This line implies a breakdown of dialogue with the West and critiques Western diplomatic engagement, discrediting Western diplomacy."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "parar de encher a Ucrânia com armas e, então, a guerra vai acabar",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies the war is prolonged due to arming Ukraine by external actors, shifting responsibility away from Russia."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Kiev não tem hipóteses de recuperar todo o território tomado pela Rússia",
      "reasoning": "The sentence presents a future-oriented assessment about Ukraine's prospects in the war (its ability to regain territory), which is a speculative outcome. It does not map neatly onto the more specific subnarratives (Russian army collapsing, Russian army losing all occupied territories, or Ukrainian army collapsing), so it fits the general 'Other' category under the parent narrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Agora, não há tal diálogo\"",
      "reasoning": "Lavrov asserts that there is no such dialogue with the Biden administration, implying that Western diplomacy is not functioning currently; the text also contrasts this with past high-level dialogue under Trump, suggesting a decline in diplomatic effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Os aliados europeus dos Estados Unidos manifestaram preocupação com a escolha de Vance.\"",
      "reasoning": "European allies' concern signals divergence or lack of a cohesive Western stance on Ukraine, which supports a view of Western unity being unsettled."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"continua a ser a principal ameaça para as nossas eleições\"",
      "reasoning": "The reference to Russia as a threat to Western electoral integrity highlights vulnerabilities of the West, serving as a remainder to the parent narrative beyond the specific subnarratives above."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "parar de encher a Ucrânia com armas e, então, a guerra vai acabar",
      "reasoning": "Lavrov argues that stopping Western arms shipments to Ukraine would end the war, effectively blaming Western actions for prolonging the conflict and shifting responsibility away from Russia."

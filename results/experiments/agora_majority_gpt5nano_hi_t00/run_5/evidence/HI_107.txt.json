      "reasoning": "The text frames potential futures (e.g., a direct Russia-NATO clash leading toward a third world war and mentions nuclear war with implied consequences) as possibilities rather than making concrete claims about army collapses or territorial losses, which aligns with the broad 'Other' subcategory for war-outcome speculation."

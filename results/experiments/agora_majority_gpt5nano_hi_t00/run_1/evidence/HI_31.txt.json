      "reasoning": "The text presents media reporting about the claim but notes that the media outlet does not claim the video’s authenticity, indicating a critical attitude toward media claims and exhibiting distrust toward media in general; since this distrust does not map to the specific subnarratives about Western or Ukrainian media, it falls under the 'Other' category."

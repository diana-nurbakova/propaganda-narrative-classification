      "reasoning": "The text attributes Russia's worsened condition to Western restrictions, portraying Russia as a victim rather than focusing on its own actions; there is no explicit claim of Russophobia or that Ukraine is extremists, so this aligns with the 'Other' subnarrative under the Russia is the Victim parent.

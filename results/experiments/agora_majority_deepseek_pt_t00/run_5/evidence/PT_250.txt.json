      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes Western countries, suggesting their efforts to pressure Russia (through sanctions) were ineffective and based on an overestimation of their own capabilities. It undermines the Western strategy and portrays it as a failure."

      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "While not a direct prediction, this statement highlights a significant strategic shift where Russia successfully reorients its energy exports to China, implying that Western sanctions failed to isolate Russia and instead strengthened its partnership with a major global power.

      "reasoning": "This quote praises Russia's resilience and economic performance in the face of Western sanctions, supporting the parent narrative of praising Russia. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about military might, Putin, peace/prosperity, or national support for the invasion, as it focuses on economic resilience and the failure of external pressure."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that Western countries overestimated their ability to exert effective pressure on Russia, portraying the West's actions as ineffectual and its power as diminished, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as non-potent."

      "evidence_quote": "A Rússia passou a sofrer sanções internacionais, sobretudo dos Estados Unidos e Europa, depois da invasão à Ucrânia em fevereiro de 2022. O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by framing Western sanctions as a failure that backfired, strengthening Russia's partnership with China instead of isolating it. This argument undermines the West's strategic efforts but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western pressure (sanctions) has been less effective than anticipated, implying the sanctions have failed and thus backfired by not achieving their goal of crippling Russia."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by showing a negative consequence for the West: Western sanctions have pushed Russia into a stronger economic partnership with China, thereby reducing Western influence and creating a rival economic bloc, which is a strategic loss for the West not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

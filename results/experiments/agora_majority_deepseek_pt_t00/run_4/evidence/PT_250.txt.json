      "reasoning": "The quote positively highlights Russia's economic resilience and stability in the face of sanctions, framing its export performance as a key factor in ensuring the country's economic performance. This is an expression of positive evaluation of Russia's actions and economic strength."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes Western countries, suggesting their efforts to pressure Russia (through sanctions) have been ineffective and miscalculated. It undermines the competence and strategic judgment of Western policies."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement highlights a consequence of Western sanctions—the consolidation of Russia's energy partnership with China. It implies the West's actions have failed to isolate Russia and instead strengthened an alternative economic bloc, which can be framed as a negative strategic outcome for Western interests."

      "reasoning": "This quote praises Russia's resilience and economic performance despite Western sanctions, supporting the overarching 'Praise of Russia' narrative. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about military might, Putin, peace/security guarantees, or explicit national support for the invasion, but it clearly praises Russia's strategic and economic strength."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that Western countries overestimated their ability to pressure Russia, portraying their actions as ineffective and thus presenting the West as a non-potent group."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A Rússia passou a sofrer sanções internacionais, sobretudo dos Estados Unidos e Europa, depois da invasão à Ucrânia em fevereiro de 2022. O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by framing Western sanctions as a failure that backfired, strengthening Russia's partnership with China instead of isolating it. This argument discredits the Western diplomatic strategy but does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western pressure (sanctions) has been ineffective, implying the intended consequences for Russia have failed and, by extension, the sanctions have backfired by not achieving their goal."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by showing a negative consequence for the West (loss of economic leverage, strengthening of a rival alliance) due to the sanctions regime, but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows. It describes a geopolitical realignment that harms Western interests."

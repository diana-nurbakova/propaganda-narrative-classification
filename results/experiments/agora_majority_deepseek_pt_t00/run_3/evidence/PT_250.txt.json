      "reasoning": "The quote positively highlights Russia's economic resilience and stability in the face of international sanctions, framing its export performance as a key factor in ensuring the country's economic performance. This is an expression of positive evaluation of Russia's actions and economic strength."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes Western countries, suggesting their efforts to pressure Russia (through sanctions) have been ineffective and miscalculated. It undermines the competence and strategic judgment of Western policies."

      "evidence_quote": "A Rússia passou a sofrer sanções internacionais, sobretudo dos Estados Unidos e Europa, depois da invasão à Ucrânia em fevereiro de 2022. O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Western sanctions as an event that ultimately led to a negative consequence for the West's strategic interests: the consolidation of a powerful Russia-China economic partnership, shifting Russia's primary energy market to China and diminishing Western leverage."

      "evidence_quote": "Sechin salientou que a parceria com a China tem ajudado a garantir a segurança económica e energética dos dois países.",
      "reasoning": "The quote portrays Russia's international cooperation (with China) as a source of economic and energy security, which aligns with the narrative of Russia providing stability and prosperity to those who cooperate."

      "reasoning": "This quote praises Russia's economic resilience and strategic success in the face of Western pressure, supporting the parent narrative of praising Russia. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about military might, Putin, peace/prosperity, or national support, as it focuses on economic performance and defiance of sanctions."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly presents Western countries as having overestimated their own power and the effectiveness of their pressure (sanctions) on Russia, which aligns with the definition of portraying the West as non-potent or weaker than it believed itself to be."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A Rússia passou a sofrer sanções internacionais, sobretudo dos Estados Unidos e Europa, depois da invasão à Ucrânia em fevereiro de 2022. O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by framing Western sanctions as a failure that backfired, strengthening Russia's partnership with China instead of isolating it. This argument—that Western actions are ineffective and lead to outcomes that undermine Western goals—supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western pressure (sanctions) has been less effective than anticipated, implying the sanctions have failed and thus backfired by not crippling Russia as intended."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by showing a negative consequence for the West: Western sanctions have pushed Russia into a stronger economic partnership with China, thereby reducing Western influence and creating a rival economic bloc, which is a strategic loss for the West not covered by the more specific subnarratives."

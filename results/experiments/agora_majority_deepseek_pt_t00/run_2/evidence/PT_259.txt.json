      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Zelensky continua a massacrar cidadãos ucranianos",
      "reasoning": "This direct quote portrays the Ukrainian leader as actively killing his own citizens, which is a severe accusation designed to undermine the legitimacy and morality of the Ukrainian government and its actions."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "nem pelos manipuladores ocidentais para revogar a lei que proíbe a Ucrânia de negociar com a Rússia",
      "reasoning": "The term 'manipuladores ocidentais' (Western manipulators) criticizes and discredits Western actors, suggesting they are controlling Ukraine and preventing negotiations, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy and influence."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "nada foi feito por ninguém em relação à Ucrânia, nem por Zelensky, nem pela sua administração ou por outros ramos do governo, nem pelos manipuladores ocidentais para revogar a lei que proíbe a Ucrânia de negociar com a Rússia",
      "reasoning": "This statement shifts the blame for the lack of negotiations and, by implication, the continuation of conflict, onto Ukraine and the West for not revoking a law. It deflects responsibility away from Russia's role as the invading party."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Ninguém tem qualquer confiança nele. Todos compreendem perfeitamente que se trata de um homem que pode distorcer tudo, que pode mentir, que pode abandonar tudo, como abandonou até o seu próprio povo, atirando literalmente o povo da Ucrânia para um altar de sacrifício\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the character and trustworthiness of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, portraying him as a liar who betrays his own people, which aligns with the definition of delegitimizing Ukrainian leaders."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "\"nem por Zelensky, nem pela sua administração ou por outros ramos do governo, nem pelos manipuladores ocidentais para revogar a lei que proíbe a Ucrânia de negociar com a Rússia.\"",
      "reasoning": "The term \"manipuladores ocidentais\" (Western manipulators) frames Ukraine's actions as being controlled or heavily influenced by Western powers, which matches the subnarrative definition."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Bem, exceto o facto de Zelensky continuar a massacrar cidadãos ucranianos\"",
      "reasoning": "The accusation that Zelensky is 'massacring' Ukrainian citizens implicitly refers to the conduct of the Ukrainian military and government's war efforts, undermining their professionalism and portraying them as harming their own people."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Não há nada de novo na intenção do regime de Kiev e dos seus manipuladores ocidentais de se reabilitarem pela chamada cimeira de paz falhada.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by discrediting Ukraine's peace efforts as a failed attempt at rehabilitation for the 'Kiev regime' and its Western handlers. It attacks Ukrainian policy and initiatives but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives provided (e.g., it's not solely about government corruption, military failure, or being a puppet, but a broader dismissal of its diplomatic actions)."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "Não há nada de novo na intenção do regime de Kiev e dos seus manipuladores ocidentais de se reabilitarem pela chamada cimeira de paz falhada. Compreendemos que estas tentativas vão continuar. Por detrás disto está o desejo de impor a 'fórmula Zelensky', que é um beco sem saída, a um vasto leque de países",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly discredits diplomatic efforts by labeling the 'peace summit' as failed and the 'Zelensky formula' as a dead end, arguing that attempts to promote it are futile and will continue to fail."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "nem por Zelensky, nem pela sua administração ou por outros ramos do governo, nem pelos manipuladores ocidentais para revogar a lei que proíbe a Ucrânia de negociar com a Rússia",
      "reasoning": "The term 'manipuladores ocidentais' (Western manipulators) frames the West as controlling Ukraine for its own ends, specifically by not allowing Ukraine to revoke a law prohibiting negotiations, implying the West's interests override Ukraine's sovereign decisions and fate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ouvimos muitas palavras, mas basicamente não vemos quaisquer atos. Bem, exceto o facto de Zelensky continuar a massacrar cidadãos ucranianos",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by dismissing diplomatic words as empty and accusing the Ukrainian leader of atrocities, but it does not cleanly fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, fatigue, or a specific claim that diplomacy won't work based on the quote used for that subnarrative). It is a distinct, manipulative argument undermining the credibility of the Ukrainian side and, by extension, the diplomatic efforts supported by the West."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Bem, exceto o facto de Zelensky continuar a massacrar cidadãos ucranianos\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts the responsibility for violence and death in Ukraine onto the Ukrainian leader, portraying him as the aggressor who is killing his own people, rather than attributing the casualties to the Russian invasion."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "\"nem pelos manipuladores ocidentais para revogar a lei que proíbe a Ucrânia de negociar com a Rússia\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement blames 'Western manipulators' for preventing Ukraine from negotiating with Russia, shifting responsibility for the continuation of the conflict away from Russia and onto the West as the controlling aggressors."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Por detrás disto está o desejo de impor a 'fórmula Zelensky', que é um beco sem saída, a um vasto leque de países\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by blaming the Ukrainian regime and its peace initiatives for creating a deadlock and attempting to impose its will on other countries, which is a form of blaming others for the war's dynamics but does not fit neatly into the 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' categories."

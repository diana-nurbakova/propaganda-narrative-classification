    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the implementation of street zoning barriers, which are likely part of climate or traffic reduction policies, by framing them as an unjust imposition and celebrating their destruction. This directly questions the effectiveness and acceptability of such climate-related measures."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' implies a deliberate deception or manipulation by authorities or institutions regarding climate policies, challenging their integrity and intentions. This aligns with the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' dismisses the climate movement as irrational or extreme, directly challenging its motives and impact. This fits the definition of criticizing the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'The Climate Con' suggests a belief in a hidden, deceptive scheme by powerful groups (e.g., governments, institutions, or elites) to manipulate public opinion or policy for ulterior motives. This aligns with the narrative of hidden plots by secret schemes."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The destruction of street zoning barriers implies that residents view these climate-related measures as ineffective or unnecessary, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' broadly criticizes climate policies as deceptive or fraudulent, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting the specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit-driven motives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers... Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the UK government's climate policies by framing them as 'climate change madness' and portraying resistance to these policies as a justified and necessary action. This directly disapproves of how the national government is handling climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Piers Corbyn and friends are taking to the streets on Friday the 13th of January.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of Piers Corbyn, a political figure known for opposing climate policies, and the framing of his actions as part of a broader resistance, discredits political figures and organizations associated with climate change initiatives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'The Climate Con' broadly criticizes institutions and authorities involved in climate policy without specifying a particular entity, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' suggests that the climate movement is exaggerating the severity of climate change, framing it as irrational or overly dramatic, which aligns with the definition of the 'Climate movement is alarmist' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' implies that the climate movement is deceptive or fraudulent, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other specific subnarratives. This constitutes a remainder that requires the 'Other' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers... resistance to the climate change madness in the UK... The Great Climate Con... resistance to The Climate Con",
      "reasoning": "The text frames climate policies (e.g., 'street zone sectioning barriers') as part of a deceptive scheme ('The Climate Con') orchestrated by powerful, unseen groups. This implies a hidden agenda rather than addressing the policies on their merits, aligning with the parent narrative of secret plots by powerful groups. The term 'con' explicitly suggests manipulation, but the text does not fit a more specific subnarrative, so 'Other' is appropriate."

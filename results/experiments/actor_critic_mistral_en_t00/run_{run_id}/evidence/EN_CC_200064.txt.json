      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage during Sweden’s Strictly Come Dancing final over the weekend.",
      "reasoning": "The text describes the climate activists as 'radical' and focuses on the disruptive nature of their protest, which challenges the motives and impact of the climate movement by portraying them as reckless or extreme."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "While the quote itself is a statement from the activists, the framing of the text emphasizes the perceived absurdity or disconnect of their actions (disrupting a dance competition) with their stated goals, thereby criticizing the climate movement's methods and integrity."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of law enforcement and potential charges subtly reinforces the authority's role in maintaining order, implying that the activists' actions were illegitimate or unlawful, which indirectly challenges the activists' competence or intentions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The quote from the activist group's statement suggests an extreme, catastrophic framing of climate change, which aligns with the subnarrative that the climate movement exaggerates the severity of the issue for dramatic effect."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator... Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane",
      "reasoning": "The use of derogatory terms like 'radical climate activist' and 'Eco-Loon' directly attacks the character and reputation of the activists, fitting the definition of ad hominem attacks on key figures in the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "I think that in this case it became dangerous because it happened in the middle of a dance where a heavily pregnant woman is participating. Then it becomes very important to do something, and I wish I had intervened earlier.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate activists' methods by highlighting the perceived recklessness and danger of their actions, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The quote from the activist group's statement suggests an extreme, catastrophic framing of climate issues, which aligns with the subnarrative that the climate movement exaggerates the severity of climate change for dramatic effect."

      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator... Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane",
      "reasoning": "The use of derogatory terms like 'Eco-Loon' and the framing of the activist being 'decked' by a camera crane serves to ridicule and attack the reputation of the activists, fitting the definition of ad hominem attacks on key figures in the climate movement."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "I think that in this case it became dangerous because it happened in the middle of a dance where a heavily pregnant woman is participating. Then it becomes very important to do something, and I wish I had intervened earlier.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the activists' methods and implies recklessness, supporting the parent narrative that the climate movement is misguided or irresponsible, but it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. Thus, it qualifies for 'Other'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The activist group Restore Wetlands claimed responsibility for the act, saying: 'Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes the perceived extremism and disruptive tactics of the activist group, which can be interpreted as a broader discrediting of political organizations and figures involved in climate activism. The framing implies skepticism toward their methods and messaging, aligning with the subnarrative of criticizing political organizations in the climate debate."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "However, their stunt was short lived, with a large camera on a crane quickly swooping in and knocking down a male activist. The others were promptly tackled and apprehended.",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text indirectly criticizes the authorities' response (e.g., law enforcement and event security) to the activists' disruption, suggesting a narrative of overreach or inefficacy in handling such protests. While it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, it still supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities."

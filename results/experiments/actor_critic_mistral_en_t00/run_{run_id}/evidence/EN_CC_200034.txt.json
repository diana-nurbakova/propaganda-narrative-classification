      "evidence_quote": "Six billion people is a lot of people. Six billion deaths are about as genocidal as it gets, so what is possessing these 'Just Stop Oil' members to take the position they do when employing it would kill the vast majority of the planet? The answer, in part, is propaganda.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by implying that the climate movement is misguided and dangerous, but it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.' It instead frames the movement as propagandistic and genocidal, which is distinct from the provided subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "As the end of the biblical age of grace approaches, the world is increasingly coming unhinged, including environmentally as the birth pangs intensify. The theory that climate fanatics have adopted as to why this is all happening blames human activity and industry, even though the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement by dismissing its scientific basis and attributing environmental changes to natural causes, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific subnarratives provided. It frames the movement as fanatical and misinformed."

      "reasoning": "This phrase directly challenges the notion of man-made climate change and promotes skepticism about its existence, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting into any of the specific subnarratives provided. It serves as a remainder that reinforces downplaying climate change without specifying a mechanism."

Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",

      "reasoning": "This phrase supports the parent narrative by implying that climate activists are naive or misguided, but it does not fit the specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motives. It instead questions the awareness or intentions of climate policy proponents, which aligns with the parent narrative but not the predefined subnarratives."

According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "These statements support the parent narrative by criticizing green technologies and climate activism but do not fit the specific subnarratives of renewable energy being dangerous, unreliable, or costly, nor do they address nuclear energy. They instead focus on the perceived catastrophic consequences of abandoning fossil fuels and question the scientific basis for climate action."

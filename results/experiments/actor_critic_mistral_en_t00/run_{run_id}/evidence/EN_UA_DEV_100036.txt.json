      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "As Ukraine endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion, the impact extends far beyond the physical destruction of its cities and the displacement of its people.",
      "reasoning": "While the text explicitly mentions 'Russia's full-scale invasion,' the focus is primarily on the consequences for Ukraine rather than assigning direct blame to Russia for initiating the war. The narrative subtly shifts attention to the suffering of Ukrainians without reinforcing Russia's responsibility for the invasion itself, which could be seen as downplaying the aggressor's role."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "This crisis in healthcare is set against a backdrop of long-standing distrust in mental health services in Ukraine, a legacy of the Soviet era when the psychiatric system was used to oppress dissidents and enemies of the state. A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines the legitimacy and effectiveness of Ukraine's healthcare system, particularly its mental health services, by highlighting historical and perceptual flaws. It portrays Ukraine as institutionally flawed, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "Nonetheless, Ukrainian resilience knows no limits, and the people will endure whatever it takes for the cause of victory, as the sacrifices being made are endless for its people.",
      "reasoning": "While this statement praises Ukrainian resilience, it implicitly frames Russia as the perpetrator of endless suffering, which could be interpreted as a subtle victimization of Russia by emphasizing the 'endless sacrifices' Ukrainians must endure. However, this is a weaker example and may not fully fit the narrative."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "This perception presents a significant challenge in encouraging people to seek necessary mental health treatment.",
      "reasoning": "This quote does not directly apply to distrust in media. However, the broader context of the text highlights distrust in Ukrainian institutions, including healthcare, which could indirectly contribute to a narrative of systemic distrust. This does not strongly fit the definition, so it is excluded."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "As Ukraine endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion, the impact extends far beyond the physical destruction of its cities and the displacement of its people.",
      "reasoning": "While the text explicitly mentions 'Russia's full-scale invasion,' the framing of the entire piece focuses on the consequences of the war (e.g., mental health crisis, economic hardship, displacement) without directly attributing blame to Russia for starting the war. This could implicitly support a narrative that shifts focus away from Russia's aggression by emphasizing the suffering of Ukrainians as a result of external forces (e.g., the West's involvement or failure to prevent the war). However, this is a weaker example and may not fully align with the subnarrative. A stronger case would require explicit blame-shifting, which is not present here."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The ongoing war in Ukraine has also significantly impacted the nation's healthcare infrastructure, particularly affecting mental health services.",
      "reasoning": "The text repeatedly emphasizes the consequences of the war (e.g., mental health crisis, economic hardship, displacement) without explicitly reiterating Russia's role as the aggressor. While it does not directly blame others, the focus on the war's impact rather than its cause could indirectly support the parent narrative by omitting or downplaying Russia's responsibility. This constitutes a remainder that aligns with the parent narrative but does not fit the specific subnarratives provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "The full-scale invasion has magnified Ukraine's pre-existing challenges and introduced larger societal issues. The collective impact of population displacement, healthcare infrastructure destruction, and economic hardships contributes significantly to the deteriorating mental health of the society. Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly portrays Ukraine as facing insurmountable challenges with no clear resolution, emphasizing the lack of a positive future outlook. It aligns with the definition of the subnarrative by suggesting that the situation is dire and without hope."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Those registered as internally displaced people (IDPs) can receive a monthly allowance of UAH 2,000 ($52.77) per adult and UAH 3,000 ($79.15) per child from the program that was created by the government. The challenges within Ukraine extend beyond physical dangers. Financial hardships are widespread, with 78% reporting reduced incomes and a third losing jobs due to the war. Consumer prices surged by 20% in 2022, and government aid doesn’t help much.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the Ukrainian government's policies and effectiveness, particularly in addressing the financial hardships of internally displaced persons. It portrays the government as inadequate and ineffective, which aligns with the subnarrative's definition of delegitimizing the government and its policies."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The impact of the war extends beyond physical damage, as it profoundly traumatizes Ukrainian society and threatens to affect future generations. The destruction of infrastructure and economic downturn complicates access to quality mental health services, a critical issue as the country grapples with the widespread societal trauma caused by the war. A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments. This perception presents a significant challenge in encouraging people to seek necessary mental health treatment.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by highlighting systemic failures in mental health infrastructure and societal trauma, it does not neatly fit into any of the specific subnarratives provided. It emphasizes long-standing issues and systemic distrust, which contribute to the broader discrediting of Ukraine but are not explicitly covered by the other subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence",
      "evidence_quote": "As Ukraine endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion, the impact extends far beyond the physical destruction of its cities and the displacement of its people.",
      "reasoning": "The phrasing 'Russia's full-scale invasion' is presented as a given, but the broader context of the article focuses on the consequences of the war without explicitly justifying Russia's actions. However, the absence of any mention of Russia's aggression as a deliberate act (e.g., framing it as a response to perceived threats) subtly aligns with the subnarrative that Russia's actions are not a deliberate choice but a reaction, which could be interpreted as self-defence in a propagandistic lens."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The mental toll of Russia's invasion on Ukrainians is profound... Russia’s war against Ukraine has led to significant territorial occupation, destruction of homes, and one of the largest migration crises this century.",
      "reasoning": "While the text describes the consequences of the war on Ukraine, it frames the conflict as 'Russia’s war against Ukraine' without contextualizing the causes or Russia's role as an aggressor. This passive framing subtly shifts focus away from Russia's responsibility, supporting the parent narrative that Russia is the victim of Western or Ukrainian hostility. This does not fit the specific subnarratives but still aligns with the broader 'Russia is the Victim' theme."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This crisis in healthcare is set against a backdrop of long-standing distrust in mental health services in Ukraine, a legacy of the Soviet era when the psychiatric system was used to oppress dissidents and enemies of the state. A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not directly target media institutions, it reinforces a broader narrative of systemic distrust within Ukrainian institutions, including healthcare, which aligns with the parent narrative of fostering distrust. This quote supports the parent narrative by implying institutional untrustworthiness, though it does not fit the specific subnarratives of distrust toward Western or Ukrainian media."

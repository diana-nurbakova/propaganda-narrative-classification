Illinois' 100 percent zero-carbon energy generation pipe dream is scheduled for five years later in 2050. ... Michigan's 100 percent green energy generation target is scheduled for 2040.",
      "reasoning": "The text describes the climate policies as 'pipe dreams' and uses dismissive language ('100 percent zero-carbon energy generation'), suggesting that these policies are unrealistic and unlikely to achieve their intended environmental goals."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by framing green energy as a corrupt, top-down imposition that disregards local autonomy and benefits elites, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives of danger, unreliability, or cost. Thus, it qualifies for 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "Local governments in these four left-leaning states no longer have authority over their own land when it comes to the green projects being pushed by state-level bureaucrats... By depriving rural residents of their right to just say no to green energy scams, the state-level 'greenies' who control California, Illinois, Michigan and New York are pandering to corporate interests while lining their own pockets, all at the expense of their constituents.",
      "reasoning": "This passage suggests that green policies are imposed by state-level authorities (often urban or elite-driven) on rural communities, stripping them of autonomy over their land and resources. This mirrors neo-colonial dynamics where external powers (or centralized governments) exert control over local populations."

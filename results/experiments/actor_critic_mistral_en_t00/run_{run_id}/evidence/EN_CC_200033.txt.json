      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism. Run your eye down the contributors to The Climate Book and you can see who she’s been reading: Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Naomi Klein. For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the motives and integrity of Greta Thunberg and the broader climate movement, framing their goals as ideologically driven (anti-capitalism) rather than genuinely environmental. It aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement by questioning their true intentions."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the offshoot of which, Just Stop Oil, is currently engaged in blocking roads across London, admitted in his own words that his movement 'isn’t about the climate.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly criticizes the climate movement by highlighting a confession from a key figure that the movement's goals are not genuinely about climate change, thus challenging its integrity and impact."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a 'scam' which facilitates 'greenwashing, lying and cheating'.",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the competence and integrity of the COP (Conference of the Parties) institution, framing it as dishonest and ineffective, which aligns with the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the climate movement is a covert plot by powerful ideological groups (radical leftists) to advance their agenda under the guise of environmental concern, fitting the narrative of hidden plots by secret schemes."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The only solution to this state of emergency is for rich countries to immediately abandon economic expansion as a social goal.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the economic impact and feasibility of proposed climate policies (abandoning economic growth), aligning with the definition of criticizing climate policies."

      "evidence_quote": "Thunberg made the extremist comments during an appearance on Sunday night at London’s Royal Festival Hall to promote her new ‘Climate Book’. Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly describes Greta Thunberg as an 'alarm bell' and 'climate Cassandra,' suggesting that her role and the climate movement's messaging are exaggerated or overly dramatic, aligning with the definition of the subnarrative."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a 'scam' which facilitates 'greenwashing, lying and cheating'. Only overthrow of 'the whole capitalist system' will suffice.",
      "reasoning": "The text alleges that the climate movement (via COP) is engaged in 'greenwashing, lying and cheating,' implying corruption or unethical practices, which fits the subnarrative definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto. [...] most Extinction Rebellion protesters are upper middle class snobs who do little but inconvenience and harm the working class.",
      "reasoning": "The text uses derogatory language ('demented manifesto') to attack Greta Thunberg and dismisses Extinction Rebellion protesters as 'upper middle class snobs,' which constitutes ad hominem attacks on key activists."

      "reasoning": "The text describes Thunberg's rhetoric as 'extremist' and compares her to a 'climate Cassandra,' implying she exaggerates the severity of climate change for dramatic effect, which aligns with the definition of the subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "The text attacks Thunberg's reputation by calling her manifesto 'demented' and labeling her message as 'radical and militant,' which constitutes a direct ad hominem attack on a key activist."

      "reasoning": "The text argues that the climate movement's true goal is to dismantle Western capitalism and replace it with a far-left ideology, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions. This qualifies as a remainder under 'Other.'"

      "evidence_quote": "Greta Thunberg has gone fully mask off and is now calling for the overthrow of 'the whole capitalist system.'... Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra. Her role was to warn, not to instruct: her most viral moments involved her scolding political leaders, not trying to supplant them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Greta Thunberg, a prominent political figure in the climate debate, by portraying her shift from a neutral 'alarm bell' to a radical political actor seeking to overthrow systems. This aligns with the subnarrative of discrediting political figures in the context of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly mention the EU, the broader implication that climate policies (often associated with the EU's regulatory framework) are a guise for radical leftism can be interpreted as criticism of the EU's role in climate change. This is a stretch but aligns with the subnarrative's definition of disapproval of the EU's approach."

      "evidence_quote": "The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion... admitted in his own words that his movement 'isn’t about the climate.'... Basden asserted that whatever climate problems exist can’t be fixed and that the movement should instead be focused on tearing down the entire system of western capitalism... So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text criticizes environmental movements and their alleged hidden agendas, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities but does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives.

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the underlying motives of climate activism as being more about dismantling Western capitalism and imposing a far-left ideology rather than addressing climate issues. While it supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies, it does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives, thus qualifying for 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the competence and decision-making of the UK Prime Minister and his government, implying internal disagreement and external pressure, which aligns with the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Sunak has been sending mixed signals about his government’s energy and climate policies. The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the consistency and effectiveness of the UK government's climate policies, highlighting policy reversals and demotions of key climate figures, which fits the definition of criticizing climate policies."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the UK government's inconsistent and contradictory handling of climate policies, including reversing decisions and demoting key climate figures, which aligns with the definition of disapproving national governments' approach to climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote discredits political figures (Sunak, Johnson, and the broader Conservative Party) by highlighting internal pressure and criticism over Sunak's initial decision to skip COP27, which fits the subnarrative of criticizing political organizations and figures in the context of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Downing Street also confirmed that King Charles III, who last year told COP26 in Glasgow that the world have to be on a ‘war-like footing’ over climate change, will not attend the summit. The new monarch was advised not to go by former Prime Minister Liz Truss.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the decision-making process of the UK monarchy and government (via Truss's advice) regarding climate engagement, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. It highlights institutional interference in climate-related participation."

      "evidence_quote": "Sunak has been sending mixed signals about his government’s energy and climate policies.",

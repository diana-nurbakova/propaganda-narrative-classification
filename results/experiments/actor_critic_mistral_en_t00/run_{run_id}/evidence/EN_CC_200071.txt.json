More than half of this endowment will go to implementing a universal 'energy conservation code' that will compel homeowners to spend as much as $31,000 to renovate their homes to be in compliance with this directive.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies, it does not neatly fit the specific subnarratives of 'ineffective,' 'negative economic impact,' or 'only for profit.' It highlights coercive and costly regulatory measures, which is a distinct argument against climate policies."

      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American... Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that 'lower greenhouse gas emissions' and fight the so-called 'climate crisis.'... This additional spending for owners of houses and residential buildings comes at a period in the United States when families are already struggling to afford a home.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly criticizes the Biden administration and its Department of Energy for implementing policies that are portrayed as harmful to the average American, particularly in making housing unaffordable. This directly aligns with the definition of criticizing national governments' handling of climate change."

These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'... State and local governments that take advantage of the Biden administration's funding for implementing green building codes would further be spurred to eventually phase out the use of natural gas in homes and residential buildings – which could make energy costs even more expensive as cheap natural gas disappears.",
      "reasoning": "While the text heavily criticizes institutions and authorities, some arguments—such as the broader critique of the feasibility and environmental impact of green energy policies—do not neatly fit into the predefined subnarratives. These statements support the parent narrative but extend beyond specific criticism of the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures, warranting the inclusion of 'Other'."

More than half of this endowment will go to implementing a universal 'energy conservation code' that will compel homeowners to spend as much as $31,000 to renovate their homes to be in compliance with this directive.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes the financial burden imposed on homeowners by green policies, framing them as economically abusive and coercive. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate-related international relations (or domestic policies framed as part of a global agenda) are exploitative."

These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by suggesting that green policies are part of a broader, potentially geopolitically motivated agenda to control energy resources and economic prosperity. However, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism,' as it focuses more on the inefficacy and hidden motives of green policies rather than direct exploitation or colonial control."

      "reasoning": "While these quotes criticize the climate movement's policies and their economic and practical impacts, they do not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.' They instead focus on the perceived inefficacy and negative consequences of green policies, supporting the parent narrative but not a predefined subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted... newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote questions the effectiveness and practicality of renewable energy sources, implying that the methodologies and metrics used to justify the shift away from fossil fuels are flawed or unreliable. It suggests that the science behind renewable energy is not sound enough to support the energy demands of the nation or world."

How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the broader implications of green policies but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided. It questions the overall impact and rationale of climate policies without directly addressing the scientific methodologies, data, or the scientific community itself."

      "evidence_quote": "IRONIC? Tesla is building the world's largest supercharger station, but it's powered by a diesel power plant. BLINDED by MONEY: Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations. John Kerry admits NUCLEAR ENERGY is necessary but continues to push for wind and solar instead.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies skepticism about the efficacy of green energy solutions and the motives behind climate policies, indirectly suggesting that the focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions (like carbon dioxide) may not be justified or effective. The mention of wind farms causing environmental harm and the push for less efficient energy sources despite acknowledging nuclear energy's necessity undermines the argument that greenhouse gases are the primary driver of climate change."

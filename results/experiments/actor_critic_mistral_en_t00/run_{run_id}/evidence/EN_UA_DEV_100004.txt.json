      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'notorious' and the emphasis on Ukrainian aircraft carrying missiles portrays Ukraine as an aggressive actor, undermining its legitimacy and intentions."

      "evidence_quote": "Russian strikes reportedly hit the Mirgorod airfield in the Poltava region, from where Ukrainian aircraft armed with Storm Shadow missiles are taking off to attack Russian rear areas. More explosions thundered in the area of the notorious Starokonstantinov airfield in the Khmelnitsk region. Ukrainian Su-24MR aircraft of the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade are based at there. They are the main carriers of Storm Shadow / SCALP cruise missiles.",
      "reasoning": "This quote emphasizes that Ukrainian aircraft are using Western-supplied missiles (Storm Shadow/SCALP) to attack Russian forces, implying that the West is enabling or fueling the aggression, thus shifting blame to the Western block."

      "evidence_quote": "the local sources are hiding any information about the damage, but some supposed that another facility used for accommodation of Ukrainian servicemen was hit.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that Ukrainian military facilities are being targeted and that Ukrainian authorities are concealing information, which undermines the effectiveness and transparency of the Ukrainian armed forces."

      "reasoning": "This phrase supports the parent narrative by emphasizing the scale and intensity of Russian military actions across Ukraine, contributing to a broader discrediting of Ukraine's ability to defend itself, but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative categories."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian forces continue massive strikes throughout Ukraine. Over the past night, at least seven large explosions thundered in the town of Chuguev in the Kharkiv region. The local authorities confirmed that the Russian attack was successful... Russian strikes reportedly hit the Mirgorod airfield in the Poltava region... More explosions thundered in the area of the notorious Starokonstantinov airfield in the Khmelnitsk region.",

      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainian sources are hiding any information about the damage, but some supposed that another facility used for accommodation of Ukrainian servicemen was hit.",
      "reasoning": "While not explicit, the implication that some local sources (potentially sympathetic to Russia) are downplaying Ukrainian losses or highlighting Russian successes subtly suggests indirect support or alignment with Russian actions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Russian invasion has strong national support",
      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, the Russian army is developing its offensive in Avdeevka... Russian forces managed to advance from the recently captured ash dump and take control of the facilities on the northern outskirts of the large Coke and Chemical Plant.",
      "reasoning": "The portrayal of Russian forces as methodically advancing and capturing strategic positions implies a well-coordinated and supported military effort, which aligns with the subnarrative of strong national backing for the invasion."

      "evidence_quote": "To the north-west of Avdeevka, Russian forces have recently repelled the Ukrainian military from the village of Stepovoe... The ongoing Russian operations in various directions from their stronghold in Krasnogorovka force the Ukrainian command to transfer additional reserves to the area in an attempt to replace those completely destroyed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote emphasizes the strategic dominance and operational success of Russian forces, which supports the parent narrative of praising Russia but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It highlights the pressure Russian operations are placing on Ukrainian forces, reinforcing the image of Russian military superiority."

      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, the Russian army is developing its offensive in Avdeevka, which was turned into a large stronghold by the Ukrainian military during the war in Donbass. According to preliminary reports from the front, Russian forces managed to advance from the recently captured ash dump and take control of the facilities on the northern outskirts of the large Coke and Chemical Plant.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights Russian military advances and the capture of strategic positions, implying that Western-backed Ukrainian forces are unable to effectively resist or counter Russian offensives, thus portraying the West as militarily weak or ineffective in supporting Ukraine."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian strikes reportedly hit the Mirgorod airfield in the Poltava region, from where Ukrainian aircraft armed with Storm Shadow missiles are taking off to attack Russian rear areas... They are the main carriers of Storm Shadow / SCALP cruise missiles.",
      "reasoning": "The focus on Western-supplied missiles (Storm Shadow/SCALP) being used by Ukraine, combined with the implication that these strikes are targeting Russian interests rather than purely defensive Ukrainian needs, suggests that the West is only arming Ukraine for its own strategic goals, not out of genuine concern for Ukraine's fate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The local authorities confirmed that the Russian attack was successful but did not reveal its target, claiming that there were no casualties among the civilians. The local sources are hiding any information about the damage, but some supposed that another facility used for accommodation of Ukrainian servicemen was hit.",
      "reasoning": "This quote subtly discredits Western-aligned Ukrainian authorities by implying they are withholding information or downplaying the effectiveness of Russian strikes, which aligns with the broader narrative of undermining Western credibility but does not fit a specific subnarrative definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army will lose all the occupied territories",
      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, the Russian army is developing its offensive in Avdeevka, which was turned into a large stronghold by the Ukrainian military during the war in Donbass. According to preliminary reports from the front, Russian forces managed to advance from the recently captured ash dump and take control of the facilities on the northern outskirts of the large Coke and Chemical Plant.",
      "reasoning": "The text speculates on the potential outcomes of Russian advances in Avdeevka, implying that Ukrainian strongholds are being overrun. However, the framing of Ukrainian forces being 'completely destroyed' and the need to 'transfer additional reserves' subtly suggests that Ukrainian resistance is faltering, which could be interpreted as a prelude to losing occupied territories if such trends continue. This aligns with speculative outcomes about territorial control."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The ongoing Russian operations in various directions from their stronghold in Krasnogorovka force the Ukrainian command to transfer additional reserves to the area in an attempt to replace those completely destroyed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes by implying that Ukrainian forces are suffering significant losses ('completely destroyed') and are being forced into a reactive position. While it does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'collapsing' or 'losing territories,' it clearly contributes to the broader theme of predicting unfavorable outcomes for Ukraine."

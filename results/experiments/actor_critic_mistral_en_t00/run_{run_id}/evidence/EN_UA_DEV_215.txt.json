      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines Ukraine's legitimacy by emphasizing its corruption, portraying it as inherently flawed and unworthy of support, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill...",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the responsibility for potential shifts in U.S. support lies with Ukraine's corruption and the U.S. public's reaction to it, rather than Russia's invasion, shifting blame away from the aggressor."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the reliability and integrity of Hersh's claims, framing them as 'thinly sourced' and potentially propagandistic, which aligns with the narrative of distrust towards media."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes U.S. government actions and policies, suggesting incompetence or negligence in handling aid to Ukraine, which aligns with discrediting the West."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote predicts adverse outcomes for the U.S. (e.g., reduced public support, financial burden), framing corruption in Ukraine as a direct negative consequence for Western interests."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly targets the Ukrainian government and its officials by portraying them as inherently corrupt, aligning with the subnarrative's definition of delegitimizing the government and its policies."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities",
      "evidence_quote": "The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Ukraine is a center for fraud and illicit activities, particularly regarding the misuse of aid and weapons, which fits the subnarrative of Ukraine being a hub for criminal activities."

The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by undermining support for Ukraine but does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It focuses on eroding Western public opinion rather than directly discrediting Ukraine's government, military, or society."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts focus away from Russia's invasion by implying that the U.S. and NATO are the primary actors with self-serving motives, rather than framing the conflict as a response to Russian aggression. It subtly suggests that the war is driven by Western interests, aligning with the subnarrative of blaming the West for the conflict."

The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative by implying that the war's continuation is contingent on Western (particularly U.S.) support and portrays the conflict as a problem exacerbated by Western involvement rather than Russia's invasion. It does not fit the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West as aggressors directly but still shifts responsibility away from Russia."

      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The text discredits a prominent Western journalist by framing his reporting as 'Russian propaganda' and 'thinly sourced,' which aligns with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda or lacks credibility."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This thinly sourced statement, however, skims over the complexities of a very nuanced war. It is not a statement that can exist without a deeper explanation–and that explanation takes the wind out of the sails of a very damaging allegation.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes Hersh's reporting as oversimplified and misleading, implying that media narratives (even those from non-Western or alternative sources) are unreliable or manipulative. This supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly states that Western (specifically U.S.) support for Ukraine is not driven by concern for Ukraine itself but by geopolitical interests, aligning with the subnarrative that the West disregards Ukraine's fate and only acts for its own benefit."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "From this perspective, the shock and awe over the level of war-time corruption seems misplaced.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western reactions to corruption in Ukraine are disproportionate or exaggerated, implying that the West is overreacting to a perceived issue, which fits the subnarrative definition."

      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by implying that Western (U.S.) support for Ukraine is fragile and could wane due to corruption, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It suggests a broader discrediting of Western resolve without directly claiming weakness, division, or overreaction."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western support for Ukraine (including sanctions and aid) may weaken due to corruption revelations, implying that Western policies could backfire by eroding public and political will to continue backing Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Does learning that this isn’t the Disney version of war and that the side the West is fighting for is simply the lesser corrupt among the two parties mean we should soften support for Ukraine’s war effort? Does learning that there may have been contract fraud along the chain from the U.S. to Ukraine mean we should withdraw and let Putin do as Putin will?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames the issue as a dilemma for the West, implying that Western support for Ukraine is morally compromised and could lead to negative consequences (e.g., withdrawal of support or perceived hypocrisy), which aligns with the parent narrative but does not fit the specific subnarratives provided."

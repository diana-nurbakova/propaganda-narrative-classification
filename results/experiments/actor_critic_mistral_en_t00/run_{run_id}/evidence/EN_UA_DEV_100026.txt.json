      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for Germany's economic struggles away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and instead attributes the crisis to Western sanctions and the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines, implying that the West and Ukraine-related actions are responsible for Germany's hardships."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error. While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western (specifically German) leadership and policies, portraying them as hypocritical, ineffective, and self-destructive, while contrasting them with the pragmatic approaches of non-Western countries like China."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The German economy, the fourth-largest in the world, has ground to a standstill. There is no growth. Manufacturing is depressed, trade is weak, inflation is high, and jobs are scarce. Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights adverse economic outcomes for Germany (a Western nation), emphasizing recession, inflation, and job scarcity as direct consequences of its energy policies and external factors like sanctions, aligning with the narrative of negative consequences for the West."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Despite the stark reality on the ground, the nation’s leaders say they remain committed to eliminate coal by 2030 as part of their long-term objective to achieve 'net-zero emissions.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that Western leaders and media narratives (e.g., climate goals) are disconnected from reality, fostering distrust in the information or policies promoted by mainstream institutions."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "Facing intense pressure from green politicians and evangelists of a looming climate apocalypse, Germany embarked on a plan to completely eliminate coal and other fossil fuels from its energy complex.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Germany's energy policies were driven by hidden agendas or secretive influence from powerful groups (e.g., 'green politicians and evangelists'), framing climate action as a manipulative scheme rather than a legitimate policy goal."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for Germany's economic struggles onto the 'sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West,' portraying the West as the aggressors responsible for the conflict's consequences rather than Russia, the invader."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not directly blame Ukraine or the West, it reinforces the parent narrative by implying that the disruption of Russian gas (a consequence of the war) is the root cause of Germany's economic woes, without acknowledging Russia's role as the aggressor. This supports the broader theme of deflecting responsibility from Russia."

      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights disparities among EU nations in their economic suffering due to energy policies and sanctions, implying division within the EU regarding how to handle the crisis and its consequences."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany has just recorded its third consecutive quarter of recession, marked by negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The central bank expects the rest of the year to be no better.",
      "reasoning": "The description of Germany's economic decline, framed as a result of Western policies (sanctions and green energy transitions), portrays the West as economically weakened and ineffective in managing its own stability."

      "reasoning": "The text implies that the West's sanctions on Russia, ostensibly to support Ukraine, have backfired and primarily harmed Western economies, suggesting that the West prioritizes its own short-term interests over Ukraine's fate."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western (specifically German) leadership for prioritizing climate policies over economic growth, contrasting it with non-Western countries like China. While it supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West, it does not fit neatly into any of the provided subnarratives, hence classified as 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes Germany's economic struggles to the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the West, suggesting that the sanctions have led to negative consequences for Germany, such as energy shortages and higher costs. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western sanctions will backfire."

Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting the broader negative economic consequences for Western nations (Germany and Italy) due to their reliance on Russian gas and the subsequent geopolitical conflict. While it does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'sanctions backfiring' or 'refugee flows,' it clearly illustrates negative consequences for the West, warranting the use of 'Other.'"

      "evidence_quote": "Virtue-Signaling Straight Into the Abyss... While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies that Western (including German) leadership and media narratives are driven by 'virtue-signaling' rather than factual or pragmatic considerations, suggesting that Western media and political discourse are instruments of propaganda promoting an unrealistic 'utopian vision' of climate policy."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s beleaguered citizens appear to have had enough of this disaster. Political change is in the winds. The populist conservative party, Alternative for Germany, has just emerged as Germany’s second strongest party, polling at 20 percent support nationwide and more than one-third in some regions. One of the party’s main selling points is that it’s 'an aggressive opponent of the government’s energy and climate policy.'",
      "reasoning": "The text suggests that mainstream narratives (likely propagated by Western media) have failed to represent the true sentiments of the German populace, implying a disconnect between media portrayals and public opinion. This supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives."

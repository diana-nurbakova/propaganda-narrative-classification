      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame away from Russia by suggesting that the UK and US are responsible for prolonging the war, rather than acknowledging Russia's initial invasion and subsequent actions as the primary cause of the conflict."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv. The Ukrainians have, so far, been able to prevent the Russians from advancing and seizing all the territory that Moscow now claims. But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's military capabilities and portrays its forces as weak and unsustainable, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western and US involvement, portraying their actions as reckless and counterproductive, which fits the narrative of discrediting the West and its diplomatic efforts."

      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This quote predicts adverse global consequences, including the risk of a nuclear accident, as a result of Western actions, which aligns with the narrative of highlighting negative outcomes for the West and the world."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the continuation of the war onto the U.S. and U.K., portraying them as the ones who sabotaged a potential peace deal, thereby framing the West as the aggressors prolonging the conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by blaming the Ukrainian government and its Western backers for escalating the conflict, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It reinforces the idea that the war is being prolonged by external actors rather than the invader (Russia)."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained. Recently, the Russians even launched a brand new incursion into territory around the northeastern city of Kharkiv—territory that had already been recaptured by the Ukrainians in late 2022. Russia’s minefields, artillery, and punishing glide bombs have not only kept Ukrainian forces from advancing but left them struggling to hold their positions along the current front line.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by highlighting their failures in the counteroffensive, loss of territory, and inability to hold positions against Russian advances."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law that sought to boost conscription rates by making it easier for the government to find and identify draft-eligible men. But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays the Ukrainian government as desperate and incompetent in its policies, particularly in its handling of conscription, which is framed as draconian and ineffective."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly claims that Ukraine is being controlled or heavily influenced by Western powers (the UK and US), who dictated its decision to continue fighting rather than negotiate."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv. The Ukrainians have, so far, been able to prevent the Russians from advancing and seizing all the territory that Moscow now claims. But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Ukraine as having no viable prospects for success, emphasizing its dwindling resources and inability to sustain its military efforts, which aligns with the definition of the 'Situation in Ukraine is hopeless' subnarrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The escalations have not been one-sided. Russia conducted drills simulating the use of strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus and has sent warships and a submarine to the Caribbean. The Russians have also stepped up shelling and airstrikes in Ukraine in response to the strikes on their territory. None of this is necessary. The strikes on Russian territory have not translated to Ukrainian gains on the battlefield. All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text supports the parent narrative by framing Ukraine's actions as reckless and counterproductive, contributing to global instability and suffering, but it does not fit neatly into any of the predefined subnarratives. Thus, it qualifies for 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the U.S. and U.K. prioritized their own strategic interests (e.g., weakening Russia) over Ukraine's immediate well-being, implying they do not genuinely care about Ukraine's fate but rather use it as a tool for their own objectives."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "The text describes Western actions (e.g., allowing Ukraine to strike inside Russia, testing ICBMs) as 'strategically pointless provocations,' framing them as disproportionate and unnecessary, which aligns with the subnarrative of Western overreaction."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "Since then, Ukraine’s leverage over Russia has only diminished... So, accepting Russia’s offer to move this conflict from the battlefield to the negotiation table is almost certainly the best chance Ukraine will get to hold onto the eastern territory they still control. But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict...",
      "reasoning": "The text implies that diplomatic efforts (e.g., negotiating with Russia) are being ignored or undermined by the West, suggesting that diplomacy is either ineffective or not genuinely pursued, which fits the subnarrative."

Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West...",
      "reasoning": "This quote subtly undermines Western credibility by highlighting Russia's military and industrial superiority over the West, which supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West but does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western sanctions or support strategies have failed to weaken Russia and instead allowed it to strengthen its military production, implying that Western actions are counterproductive and may backfire."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by highlighting broader negative consequences for the West (and the world) due to the conflict, such as the risk of nuclear escalation, but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It emphasizes the dangers of prolonged conflict, which indirectly critiques Western policies."

      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly warns that continued escalation in the war could lead to a catastrophic nuclear accident, which aligns with the fear of a broader, potentially world-ending conflict (WWIII)."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "the US then test-fired two nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles—launching them four thousand miles from California to the Marshall Islands. The escalations have not been one-sided. Russia conducted drills simulating the use of strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus and has sent warships and a submarine to the Caribbean.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights nuclear drills, missile tests, and military posturing by both sides, which directly evokes fear of nuclear weapons being employed in the conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that NATO is taking direct action by allowing its weapons to be used for strikes inside Russia, implying a shift toward direct intervention in the conflict."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden then renewed one of his favorite tropes, asserting that if Ukraine falls, its people will be subjugated, its neighbors will be in immediate danger, and all of Europe will be threatened by Putin’s aggressive ambitions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote amplifies war-related fears by suggesting that Russia's aggression will not stop at Ukraine and will threaten all of Europe, but it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative but is distinct from the others."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, by labeling its climate policies as 'tyrannical' and implying undue influence over 'American elites.'

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the perspective of 'American elites' by suggesting they hold views that are disconnected from reality (e.g., believing there is 'too much liberty' despite evidence to the contrary). While it supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities, it does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives, thus qualifying for 'Other.'"

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames the WEF and 'American elites' as part of a hidden, coordinated scheme to impose restrictive policies on the general public under the guise of climate change.

However, 89 percent of those wealthy individuals from 'top universities' believe in restrictions on the public’s quality of life to meet 'Net Zero.' In fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote reinforces the idea of a powerful, educated elite conspiring to limit freedoms and impose policies on the public, which supports the parent narrative. The emphasis on 'top universities' and the disconnect between their beliefs and the public's aligns with the theme of hidden plots by secretive groups, warranting classification under 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames the WEF's climate policies as a form of coercion and control over the general public, portraying them as abusive or exploitative measures imposed by an international body (WEF) with the support of domestic elites. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate-related international relations are abusive or economically exploitative."

      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that policies driven by international entities (like the WEF) and supported by domestic elites are being imposed on the general public, mirroring neo-colonial dynamics where a privileged class dictates terms to the broader population. This implies a form of modern control akin to neo-colonialism."

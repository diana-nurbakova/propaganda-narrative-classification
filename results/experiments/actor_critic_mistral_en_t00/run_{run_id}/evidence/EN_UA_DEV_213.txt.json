      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the conflict away from Russia and attributes responsibility to the US and its allies, framing them as the aggressors. It aligns with the definition of blaming others rather than the invader."

      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western media and, by extension, Western diplomatic efforts, portraying them as dishonest and manipulative. It fits the definition of discrediting the West and its diplomatic narratives."

      "evidence_quote": "The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: 'Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter...'",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights perceived hypocrisy in Western diplomatic rhetoric, accusing the West of violating international norms while criticizing Russia. It reinforces the narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy."

      "evidence_quote": "As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s 'aluminum tubes' and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as 'evidence' satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia... All of this amounts to nothing.",

It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.'",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors,' it still supports the parent narrative by dismissing NATO's role in the crisis and shifting blame entirely onto Russia (Putin), which aligns with the broader theme of deflecting responsibility from the invader."

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the West (via Ukraine) is fabricating pretexts for aggression, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives. It implies that the real aggressors are the US/Ukraine, not Russia."

Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: 'NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.'",
      "reasoning": "While not explicitly stating division, the text highlights Germany's distinct and aggressive stance, implying a lack of unified EU policy and potential internal discord within the West."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.",

Fueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions. The pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point. The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative by discrediting the West (particularly the US) as internally unstable and using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic failures.

How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",

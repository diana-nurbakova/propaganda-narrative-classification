      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act... the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid shift to renewables, aligning with the definition of criticizing climate policies by highlighting potential negative consequences."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021... The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "The text implicitly challenges the competence or priorities of major banks and institutions like the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance by framing their investment shifts as potentially misguided or insufficient, which aligns with criticizing institutions and authorities."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Deutsche bank in particular drew some criticism from activist groups that considered the move to be insufficient, since it did not include similar cutbacks in oil and gas... Activist groups had previously hailed the decision from major British bank HSBC in December to not fund new oil and gas investments.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights skepticism toward the motives and demands of the climate movement, portraying activist groups as overly aggressive or inconsistent, which fits the definition of criticizing the climate movement."

      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks... submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of the Federal Reserve's pilot program implies that climate-related financial regulations could be used as tools for broader control or influence, fitting the narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments."

      "evidence_quote": "(RELATED: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Shatter Record Despite Green Investments)",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly suggests that despite significant green investments, carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise, implying that climate policies (such as green investments) are failing to achieve their intended environmental goals."

      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, it supports the parent narrative by implying that banks are diverting significant resources toward climate policies, which could be framed as misplaced prioritization without explicit criticism of effectiveness, economy, or profit motives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Both banks are founding members of the United Nations’ Net Zero Banking Alliance, which requires its 126 members to set goals and disclose financial data related to their efforts to reduce the emissions of their lending portfolio to net zero by 2050.",
      "reasoning": "The text implicitly criticizes the influence of the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance by framing its requirements as a coercive or misguided force driving banks to adopt climate policies, which aligns with the subnarrative of criticizing international entities' role in climate policy."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes a political figure (Brad Lander) for pressuring banks to adopt climate-related policies, which discredits political figures in the context of the climate change debate."

      "reasoning": "The text critiques the broader trend of banks shifting investments toward green energy, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives. This is a distinct argument that remains uncaptured by the other subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "The text implies that activist groups are pushing for extreme measures (e.g., cutting all oil and gas investments) without considering practical or transitional challenges, which aligns with the subnarrative that the climate movement exaggerates the urgency or feasibility of its demands."

U.S. banks... have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights that activist groups are never satisfied with incremental progress and continually demand more aggressive actions, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives. This suggests a pattern of relentless pressure that could be seen as unreasonable or counterproductive."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that renewable energy sources are not yet capable of replacing fossil fuels due to infrastructure and resource limitations, implying they are unreliable for widespread adoption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act... investment in clean energy technologies is critical to addressing climate change, and support for companies working to dramatically reduce their carbon footprints must continue wherever they may be on their respective journeys.",
      "reasoning": "While this statement supports the transition to green technologies, it also subtly underscores the complexity and potential challenges of relying solely on renewables, which aligns with the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives."

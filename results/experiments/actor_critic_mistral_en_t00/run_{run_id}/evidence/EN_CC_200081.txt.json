    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "The statement expresses skepticism about wind turbines by highlighting their environmental and ethical drawbacks, such as deforestation, wildlife harm, and reliance on problematic mining practices."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "The statement suggests that green energy policies inadvertently strengthen geopolitical rivals (China) by creating dependencies on their resources, framing the policies as tools for geopolitical influence rather than purely environmental efforts."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "Mr Kerr said: ‘Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,’ adding that the government ‘must be alive’ to the ‘significant costs’ of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights concerns about the economic costs and negative impacts of wind turbine installations, implying that climate policies lead to financial burdens and potential harm to local economies."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly highlights the dangers associated with wind turbines, including harm to wildlife and severe health consequences for humans due to rare earth mineral mining. This aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy sources pose significant risks or dangers."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the German government and its actions, challenging its competence and integrity in handling climate-related decisions, which aligns with the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "She and other activists say expanding the coal mine would contribute to the climate crisis and be counterproductive to Germany’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "reasoning": "This statement questions the effectiveness and motives behind Germany's climate policies, particularly the approval of coal expansion projects, which fits the definition of criticism of climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Interactions between the activists and police have grown violent at times, resulting in the hospitalizations of at least nine demonstrators.",
      "reasoning": "While not a direct criticism of the climate movement itself, the mention of violent interactions and hospitalizations could be interpreted as indirectly challenging the impact or methods of the climate movement, aligning with the narrative's definition."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the German government's actions and decisions regarding the coal mine expansion, aligning with the definition of disapproving national governments' handling of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The Garzweiler coal mine, owned by European energy giant RWE, can expand.",
      "reasoning": "While not explicitly naming political figures, the text implies criticism of the political and corporate entities (like RWE) that are driving the coal expansion, which is tied to government approvals and policies. This fits the subnarrative of discrediting political organizations and figures in the context of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Police told the BBC they arrested Thunberg and others after they “rushed towards the ledge” of the mine. All will be released without charges after their identities are checked, police said.",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text criticizes the actions of law enforcement (an authority institution) in handling the protest, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. It highlights the perceived overreach or heavy-handedness of police in dealing with climate activists."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "She and other activists say expanding the coal mine would contribute to the climate crisis and be counterproductive to Germany’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes Germany's decision to expand the coal mine, implying that the country's climate policies (e.g., phasing out coal by 2030) are ineffective or contradictory, as the expansion undermines the stated goals of reducing emissions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The country has pledged to phase out coal power generation by 2030, but it also recently approved coal expansion projects, saying they’re necessary to maintain the country’s energy security as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to disrupt oil and gas supplies.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that climate policies (e.g., phasing out coal) are being compromised due to economic and energy security concerns, implying that strict adherence to such policies would have negative economic consequences."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Video captured at the protest showed three officers carrying a seemingly unbothered Thunberg, 20, away from the demonstration",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'seemingly unbothered' subtly undermines Greta Thunberg's commitment or sincerity, attacking her reputation rather than addressing the substance of the protest or climate issues. This aligns with ad hominem attacks on key activists."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks, it supports the parent narrative by framing Thunberg's criticism of Germany's climate policies in a way that could be interpreted as dismissive or overly critical, without addressing the broader context of the protest or climate movement's goals."

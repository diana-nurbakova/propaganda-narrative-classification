    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title explicitly frames the wind energy initiative as a 'ripoff,' implying criticism of the economic impact or effectiveness of climate policies related to renewable energy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The term 'ripoff' suggests skepticism or criticism of wind energy technology, casting doubt on its value or legitimacy as a green solution."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The use of the word 'ripoff' in the title implies a challenge to the integrity or competence of the institutions and authorities (e.g., the Biden-Harris administration, Department of the Interior) promoting the wind energy auction."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title explicitly frames the wind energy auction as a 'ripoff,' implying that the policy is driven by financial motives rather than genuine environmental or public interest concerns. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies are pursued for profit rather than environmental goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'ripoff' in the title suggests that the policy is perceived as economically exploitative or wasteful, implying a negative economic impact. While the text itself does not elaborate, the framing strongly implies economic criticism."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The overarching tone of the title criticizes the climate policy (offshore wind energy auction) without specifying whether the criticism is about ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motives alone. This general critique supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives beyond the specific implications already identified."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "The lease sale represents the third major offshore wind lease sale this year and the first ever for the Pacific region. Today’s sale drew competitive high bids from 5 companies totaling $757.1 million, well exceeding the first lease sales that were held in the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights the high financial cost of offshore wind energy leases, implying that renewable energy (specifically wind) is expensive, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title itself frames the entire announcement as a 'ripoff,' suggesting a broader critique of green technologies (specifically wind energy) that does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but clearly supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title explicitly frames the offshore wind energy auction as a 'ripoff,' which directly criticizes the U.S. national government's handling of the initiative, implying mismanagement or inefficacy in climate policy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The Biden-Harris administration believes that to address the climate crisis head on, we must unleash a new era of clean, reliable energy that serves every household in America.",
      "reasoning": "While the quote itself is neutral, the framing of the article as 'The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff' suggests disapproval of the Biden-Harris administration's climate policies and portrays their efforts as flawed or deceptive, thus discrediting political figures in the context of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The interest and success of today’s sale represents a significant milestone toward achieving President Biden’s goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy capacity by 2030 and 15 gigawatts of floating offshore wind capacity by 2035.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff' casts doubt on the legitimacy and value of the entire initiative, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative categories. This broader critique of the government's approach to climate policy is distinct from the specific quotes used for the other subnarratives."

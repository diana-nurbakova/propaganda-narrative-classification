      "evidence_quote": "Washington 'cannot afford' to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "This statement shifts blame for the conflict by implying that the U.S. (and the West) is the primary actor with a vested interest in prolonging the war, rather than acknowledging Russia's role as the invader. The focus is on Western motivations rather than Russia's responsibility for the invasion."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the legitimacy and character of Ukraine's government by labeling it as corrupt and neo-Nazi, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine."

'The fate of the colonies is always the same: the Americans will scoop up all the natural resources of Ukraine in exchange for 'the great honor of being a friend of the United States'.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the U.S. and Western intentions, portraying them as exploitative and hypocritical in their foreign policy, which fits the definition of discrediting the West and its diplomatic efforts."

      "reasoning": "Though indirect, this quote contrasts Russia's perspective (as voiced by Dzhabarov) with the negative portrayal of Western actions, subtly positioning Russia as morally superior or more honest in its assessment of the situation."

'If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames Western support for Ukraine as motivated by access to Ukraine's mineral resources rather than concern for Ukraine's sovereignty or well-being. This aligns with the subnarrative that the West is only interested in Ukraine for its own economic and strategic benefits."

      "reasoning": "This portion of the text supports the parent narrative by portraying the West as exploitative and imperialistic, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarrative definitions provided.

      "reasoning": "While the quote does not explicitly praise Putin, Dzhabarov is a Russian official, and his criticism of the U.S. implicitly positions Russia as a moral authority or protector against Western exploitation. This aligns with the broader subnarrative of portraying Russian leadership positively by contrasting it with Western actions."

      "reasoning": "The text explicitly directs the reader to Sputnik's infographics while implying that Western media (e.g., CBS News and Senator Graham's statements) is distorting or omitting the true motives behind Western involvement in Ukraine. This discredits Western media by suggesting it is a tool for propaganda rather than objective reporting."

      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by implying that Western political figures (like Graham) and their statements, as reported by Western media, are deceptive and self-serving.

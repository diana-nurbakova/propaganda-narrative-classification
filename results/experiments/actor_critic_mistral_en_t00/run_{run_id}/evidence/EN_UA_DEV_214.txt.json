      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto the West, portraying the West as the primary aggressor by accusing it of escalating the conflict through military support and then falsely blaming China.

While it reinforces the idea that the West is responsible for escalation, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West as direct aggressors, hence the use of 'Other'."

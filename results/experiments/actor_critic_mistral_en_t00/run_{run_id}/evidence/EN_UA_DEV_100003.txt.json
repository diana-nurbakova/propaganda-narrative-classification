      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the portrayal of Russia's actions as an 'imperial-style land grab' is a narrative pushed by Ukraine and the West, shifting blame away from Russia's invasion by framing it as a Western misrepresentation."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict.",
      "reasoning": "This statement positively highlights Russia's perceived strength and confidence in its military actions, aligning with the definition of praising Russia's position or actions."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sacked his top general.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's military effectiveness and leadership stability, discrediting its ability to resist Russia's invasion."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.",
      "reasoning": "Medvedev explicitly speculates about future territorial gains, including the capture of Kyiv, which fits the definition of predicting or assuming war outcomes."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the West's (specifically the U.S.) diplomatic and political processes, implying inefficiency or failure in supporting Ukraine, which aligns with discrediting Western diplomacy."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The West has committed about 250 billion euros ($271 billion) worth of aid to Ukraine in an attempt to defeat Russian forces.",
      "reasoning": "While not explicitly negative, the mention of the vast financial commitment by the West implies a significant burden or potential negative consequence for Western economies, fitting the narrative of adverse outcomes for the West."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for the conflict by implying that the West and Ukraine are falsely portraying Russia's actions as aggressive, while also suggesting that Western warnings about Russia's intentions are unfounded or manipulative. This aligns with the subnarrative of portraying the West as the true aggressors or instigators of the conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev said Russia also wanted to take the Black Sea port of Odesa, which it calls Odessa. 'Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,' Medvedev said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by framing Russia's territorial ambitions as justified and natural, implying that Ukraine is illegitimately holding Russian territory. While it does not fit the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West directly, it reinforces the idea that Russia is not the aggressor but rather reclaiming what is rightfully theirs."
    },

After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization... Russia is now seeking to recapture the initiative across the 1,000 km (600-mile) front line, where its troops are dug in behind deep mine fields patrolled by drones and guarded by heavy artillery.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights Russia's military capabilities, territorial advances, and strategic positioning, portraying its forces as strong, resilient, and capable of further expansion. This directly aligns with the subnarrative of praising Russian military might."

      "reasoning": "The quote attributes military success and strategic foresight to Putin, presenting him as an effective leader who is guiding Russia to victory. This supports the subnarrative of praising Vladimir Putin."

      "reasoning": "Medvedev's statement frames the invasion as a reclaiming of historically and culturally Russian territory, implying broad national support for the military campaign. This aligns with the subnarrative of emphasizing strong national backing for the invasion."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict... Russia says the territory its forces control is part of Russia and that it will never be given up.",

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces... Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's... Russian forces expected a quick victory in 2022 but Ukrainian forces pushed Russian forces back later that year in a counteroffensive which showed serious problems in Russia's military.",
      "reasoning": "These statements aim to undermine the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian military by highlighting their failures, being outnumbered, and implying their counteroffensive was only temporarily successful due to Russian military problems, not Ukrainian strength."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by framing Ukraine and the West as propagators of a narrative that exaggerates Russian aggression, which does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives but still discredits Ukraine by association."

      "evidence_quote": "After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sacked his top general.",
      "reasoning": "This statement speculates on the war's trajectory by highlighting Ukraine's struggles (e.g., failed counteroffensive, leadership changes) and Russia's strategic advantage, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting a specific subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "The West has committed about 250 billion euros ($271 billion) worth of aid to Ukraine in an attempt to defeat Russian forces",
      "reasoning": "The phrasing 'in an attempt to defeat Russian forces' implies that the West's aid is motivated by its own strategic interests (countering Russia) rather than genuine concern for Ukraine's sovereignty or well-being."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin's suggestion of a ceasefire in Ukraine to freeze the war was rejected by the United States after contacts between intermediaries",

      "reasoning": "The text implies that Western financial and military aid to Ukraine is a futile effort, suggesting that such support will not achieve its goals and may ultimately harm Western interests. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western sanctions or interventions will backfire."

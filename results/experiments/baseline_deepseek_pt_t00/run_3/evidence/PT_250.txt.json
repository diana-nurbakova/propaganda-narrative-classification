      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes Western countries, suggesting their attempts to pressure Russia (through sanctions) have been ineffective and based on a miscalculation, thereby discrediting Western diplomatic and economic strategies."

      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies a negative consequence for the West by highlighting how Western sanctions (the mentioned 'scenario') have backfired, leading to a strengthened Russia-China partnership that diminishes Western economic influence and redirects Russian exports away from Western markets."

      "reasoning": "This quote praises Russia's resilience and economic performance in the face of Western pressure, supporting the overarching 'Praise of Russia' narrative. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about military might, Putin, peace/security guarantees, or explicit national/international support for the invasion, but it is a clear positive portrayal of Russia's strength and stability."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly presents the West as a non-potent actor whose pressure on Russia has been ineffective, which aligns with the definition of portraying the West as weak and not as powerful as it believed."

      "evidence_quote": "A Rússia passou a sofrer sanções internacionais, sobretudo dos Estados Unidos e Europa, depois da invasão à Ucrânia em fevereiro de 2022. O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by framing Western sanctions as a failure that backfired, strengthening Russia's partnership with China. This argument—that Western actions have unintended consequences that benefit Russia—supports the narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western pressure (sanctions) has been less effective than anticipated, implying the sanctions have failed and thus backfired by not achieving their intended goal of crippling Russia."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by showing a negative consequence for the West: sanctions have pushed Russia into a stronger economic partnership with China, reducing Western influence and creating a rival economic bloc, which is a strategic loss for the West not covered by the more specific subnarratives."

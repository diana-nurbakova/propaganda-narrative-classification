      "evidence_quote": "Sechin destacou que a estabilidade nas exportações de petróleo tiveram um papel importante na garantia do desempenho da economia do país nos últimos anos.",
      "reasoning": "The quote positively highlights the resilience and strength of the Russian economy in the face of sanctions, framing its export stability as a key factor for economic performance. This aligns with the narrative of praising Russia's actions and economic resilience."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes Western countries, suggesting their efforts to pressure Russia (through sanctions) were ineffective and based on an overestimation of their own capabilities. It discredits Western policy and diplomatic pressure."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "While not a direct prediction, this statement highlights a significant strategic shift where Russia redirects its energy exports to China. This implies a negative consequence for the West, as it loses leverage and Russia successfully circumvents Western sanctions, strengthening an alternative economic bloc."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity",
      "evidence_quote": "Sechin salientou que a parceria com a China tem ajudado a garantir a segurança económica e energética dos dois países.",
      "reasoning": "The quote portrays Russia's international cooperation (with China) as a source of economic and energy security, which aligns with the definition of presenting Russia as a provider of stability and prosperity to those that cooperate."

      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",

      "reasoning": "This quote praises Russia's resilience and economic performance despite Western sanctions, supporting the parent narrative of praising Russia. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about military might, Putin, peace/prosperity, or popular support for the invasion, but instead highlights Russia's economic strength and strategic success in circumventing pressure."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly presents Western countries as having overestimated their own power and the effectiveness of their pressure (sanctions) on Russia, which aligns with the definition of portraying the West as non-potent or weaker than it believed itself to be."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A Rússia passou a sofrer sanções internacionais, sobretudo dos Estados Unidos e Europa, depois da invasão à Ucrânia em fevereiro de 2022. O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by implying that Western sanctions have backfired or been ineffective, instead strengthening Russia's partnership with China. This argument discredits the West's strategic actions but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, overreaction, or fatigue, but about the failure and unintended consequences of Western policy)."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western pressure (sanctions) has been less effective than anticipated, implying the sanctions have failed and thus backfired by not achieving their goal of crippling Russia."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by showing a negative consequence for the West: sanctions have pushed Russia into a stronger economic partnership with China, thereby reducing Western influence and creating a rival economic bloc, which is a strategic loss for the West not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

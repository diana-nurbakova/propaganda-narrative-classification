      "reasoning": "The quote positively highlights Russia's economic resilience and the success of its oil export strategy, framing it as a deliberate achievement that ensured economic performance despite external pressures."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes Western countries, suggesting their attempts to pressure Russia (through sanctions) were ineffective and based on a miscalculation, thereby discrediting their strategy and diplomatic efforts."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "While not a direct prediction, this statement frames the Western sanctions as having a negative, unintended consequence for the West: it strengthened the Russia-China partnership, shifting Russia's key energy exports away from Western markets and consolidating China's position, which can be seen as a strategic loss for Western influence."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity",
      "evidence_quote": "Sechin salientou que a parceria com a China tem ajudado a garantir a segurança económica e energética dos dois países.",
      "reasoning": "The quote portrays Russia's international cooperation (with China) as a source of economic and energy security, which aligns with the narrative of Russia providing stability and prosperity to those who cooperate."

      "reasoning": "This quote praises Russia's resilience and economic performance in the face of Western sanctions, supporting the overarching 'Praise of Russia' narrative. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about military might, Putin, peace/security guarantees, or explicit national support for the invasion, but it clearly praises Russia's strategic and economic strength."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly presents Western countries as having overestimated their own power and the effectiveness of their pressure (sanctions) on Russia, implying they are not as potent as they believed, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as a non-potent group."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A Rússia passou a sofrer sanções internacionais, sobretudo dos Estados Unidos e Europa, depois da invasão à Ucrânia em fevereiro de 2022. O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by framing Western sanctions as a failure that backfired, strengthening Russia's partnership with China instead of isolating it. This argument undermines the West's diplomatic strategy but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, overreaction, or fatigue, but about the ineffectiveness and counterproductive nature of the Western response)."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western pressure (sanctions) has been ineffective, implying the sanctions have failed and thus backfired by not achieving their intended goal of crippling Russia."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by highlighting a negative consequence for the West (the consolidation of a Russia-China energy alliance) resulting from Western sanctions, but it does not fit the specific definitions of 'sanctions backfire' (which is about the sanctions' ineffectiveness) or 'refugee flows'. It describes a strategic realignment that undermines Western influence."

      "reasoning": "The quote positively highlights Russia's economic resilience and the success of its oil export strategy, framing it as a deliberate achievement that ensured economic performance, which aligns with praising Russia's actions and policies."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes Western countries, suggesting their efforts to pressure Russia (e.g., through sanctions) were ineffective and based on an overestimation of their own capabilities, which discredits Western diplomatic and economic strategies."

      "evidence_quote": "A Rússia passou a sofrer sanções internacionais, sobretudo dos Estados Unidos e Europa, depois da invasão à Ucrânia em fevereiro de 2022. O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Western sanctions as an event that backfired, leading to a strengthened Russia-China partnership and making China Russia's main oil buyer. This implies the sanctions had the negative consequence of pushing Russia into a more advantageous trade alliance, undermining the West's intended outcome."

      "reasoning": "This quote praises Russia's resilience and economic performance in the face of Western sanctions, supporting the parent narrative of praising Russia. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about military might, Putin, peace/prosperity guarantees, or national support for the invasion, as it focuses on economic resilience and the failure of external pressure."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly presents Western countries as having overestimated their own power and the effectiveness of their pressure (sanctions) on Russia, which aligns with the definition of portraying the West as non-potent or weaker than it believed itself to be."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by framing Western sanctions as a failure that backfired, strengthening Russia's partnership with China instead of isolating it. This argument discredits the Western diplomatic strategy but does not fit neatly into any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, overreaction, lack of care, diplomacy not working, or fatigue)."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western pressure (sanctions) has been ineffective, implying that the sanctions have failed to achieve their goal and have instead led to Russia strengthening its economic partnerships elsewhere, which is a negative consequence for the West's strategic aims."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by showing a specific negative consequence for the West: the sanctions have pushed Russia into a deeper economic and strategic alliance with China, thereby strengthening a geopolitical rival of the West and reducing Western economic influence."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the effectiveness and environmental trade-offs of climate policies, specifically the felling of trees for wind farms, implying that the policy may not be as 'green' as claimed."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), Mairi Gougeon, has admitted that some 15.7 million trees were cut down since the year 2000... Gougeon claimed that many of the trees would have been ‘replanted on-site’ and that the majority were expected to be cut down for commercial uses, regardless.",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the competence and integrity of the Scottish government, portraying its actions as misguided and its justifications as weak or dismissive."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people.",
      "reasoning": "The text expresses skepticism about wind turbines by highlighting their environmental and social costs, including deforestation, harm to wildlife, and unethical mining practices."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms... sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the motives and impact of the climate movement by framing its policies as harmful to the environment and local communities, implying that the movement is out of touch with public concerns."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that the climate policy of replacing trees with wind farms is counterproductive and fails to achieve its intended environmental goals, as it involves cutting down millions of trees, which are critical for carbon absorption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "Mr Kerr said: ‘Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,’ adding that the government ‘must be alive’ to the ‘significant costs’ of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'significant costs' associated with wind turbine installation, implying that climate policies lead to negative economic outcomes, particularly for rural communities and businesses."

      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting additional criticisms of climate policies, such as environmental harm to wildlife and human health risks from mining rare earth minerals, which do not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the Scottish government's actions and policies regarding climate change and renewable energy, framing them as misguided and harmful."

      "evidence_quote": "The Rural Affairs Secretary for the leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), Mairi Gougeon, has admitted that some 15.7 million trees were cut down since the year 2000...",
      "reasoning": "This quote discredits the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) and its representative, Mairi Gougeon, by highlighting their role in the controversial tree-felling policy, implying incompetence or ideological extremism."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Nevertheless, the Scottish government has vowed to continue its 'green energy' push... Renewable energy generated from wind farms is a key element in Scotland’s response to the climate emergency and the shift towards net zero...",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the Scottish government's continued commitment to wind energy, but it does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative categories. It implies that the government is ignoring the negative consequences of its policies."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly highlights the dangers associated with wind turbines, including harm to wildlife and severe health consequences for humans due to rare earth mineral mining. This aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy sources pose significant risks or dangers."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "the government 'must be alive' to the 'significant costs' of the installation of massive wind turbines... sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote emphasizes the 'significant costs' of wind turbine installation and broader economic concerns, which supports the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive or inefficient for widespread adoption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It introduces broader concerns about community opposition and business impacts, which are not explicitly covered by the other subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'supposedly ‘green energy’’ suggests skepticism about the climate movement's claims, implying that the environmental benefits are exaggerated or misleading, which aligns with the definition of the climate movement being alarmist."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms... sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business. Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the practical outcomes of the climate movement's policies (e.g., environmental damage, impact on wildlife and communities) but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by highlighting negative consequences without directly attacking activists or alleging corruption."

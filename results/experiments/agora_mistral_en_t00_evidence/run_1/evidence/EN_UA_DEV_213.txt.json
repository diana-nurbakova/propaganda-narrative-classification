      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western media and, by extension, Western diplomatic efforts, portraying them as dishonest and manipulative in their reporting and actions."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: 'Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter...'",

      "evidence_quote": "As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s 'aluminum tubes' and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as 'evidence' satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia... All of this amounts to nothing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines trust in Western media by accusing it of spreading unverified and false information, aligning with the narrative of distrust towards media."

      "evidence_quote": "The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a 'false-flag' operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion. In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by implying that Ukraine and the West are fabricating pretexts for aggression, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It suggests a broader blame-shifting mechanism that goes beyond the specific subnarratives provided."

      "evidence_quote": "The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.",
      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative by indirectly blaming historical Western actions (e.g., NATO expansion, capitalist integration) for the current crisis, but it does not fit the specific subnarratives. It attributes the root cause of the conflict to broader geopolitical dynamics rather than Russia's actions."

The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a 'false-flag' operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly accuses the West of exaggerating the threat posed by Russia and fabricating evidence to justify aggressive posturing, which aligns with the definition of the West overreacting to Russia’s actions in a disproportionate manner."

It writes: 'With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.' The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.",

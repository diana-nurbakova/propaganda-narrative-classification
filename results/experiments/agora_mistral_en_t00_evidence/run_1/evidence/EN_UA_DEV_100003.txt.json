    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the narrative of Russia's invasion as an 'imperial-style land grab' is a Western and Ukrainian fabrication, shifting blame away from Russia's actions as the invader."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights Russia's confidence in its military progress, subtly praising its strategic position and perceived success on the battlefield."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the West, specifically the U.S., for failing to provide timely support to Ukraine, implying incompetence or lack of commitment in Western diplomatic efforts."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.",
      "reasoning": "Medvedev explicitly speculates about future military actions and outcomes, predicting the potential capture of Kyiv as part of Russia's war strategy."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts responsibility for the conflict by implying that the West and Ukraine are falsely portraying Russia's actions as aggressive, while Russia's own statements (e.g., Medvedev's claims about expanding territory) are framed as justified. The narrative suggests the West is the real aggressor for supporting Ukraine and opposing Russia's territorial ambitions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev said Russia also wanted to take the Black Sea port of Odesa, which it calls Odessa. 'Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,' Medvedev said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by justifying Russia's invasion and territorial expansion as a reclaiming of historically Russian lands, rather than an act of aggression. It does not fit the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West directly but still shifts blame away from Russia as the invader."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian troops will go much further into Ukraine, taking the southern city of Odesa and might even one day push on to the capital Kyiv... After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization... Russia is now seeking to recapture the initiative across the 1,000 km (600-mile) front line, where its troops are dug in behind deep mine fields patrolled by drones and guarded by heavy artillery.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights Russia's military capabilities, territorial advances, and strategic positioning, portraying its forces as resilient, well-equipped, and dominant on the battlefield. This directly aligns with the subnarrative of praising Russian military might."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin said Tuesday that Russian troops would push further into Ukraine to build on their success on the battlefield after the weekend fall of the town of Avdiivka where he said Ukrainian troops had been forced to flee in chaos.",
      "reasoning": "The quote attributes military success and strategic foresight to Putin, presenting him as an effective and decisive leader. This supports the subnarrative of praising Vladimir Putin."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Russian invasion has strong national support",
      "evidence_quote": "'Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,' Medvedev said.",
      "reasoning": "Medvedev's statement frames the invasion as a reclaiming of historically and culturally Russian territory, implying broad national support for the military campaign. This aligns with the subnarrative of emphasizing strong national backing for the invasion."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict... Russia says the territory its forces control is part of Russia and that it will never be given up.",
      "reasoning": "These statements support the parent narrative by portraying Russia as resolute and justified in its actions, but they do not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. They emphasize Russia's determination and perceived legitimacy, warranting inclusion under 'Other'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the West, particularly the U.S., is unable to act decisively or effectively to support Ukraine, implying weakness in its resolve and capability."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The West has committed about 250 billion euros ($271 billion) worth of aid to Ukraine in an attempt to defeat Russian forces.",
      "reasoning": "The phrasing 'in an attempt to defeat Russian forces' subtly frames Western aid as being motivated by a desire to counter Russia rather than genuine concern for Ukraine's sovereignty or well-being."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin's suggestion of a ceasefire in Ukraine to freeze the war was rejected by the United States after contacts between intermediaries",
      "reasoning": "While not explicitly about the EU, the rejection of a diplomatic proposal by the U.S. (a key Western ally) without mention of unified Western or EU support implies division within the West, including the EU, on how to handle the conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying the West's warnings as exaggerated or unfounded, thereby discrediting Western diplomatic and strategic narratives without fitting neatly into the predefined subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army will lose all the occupied territories",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly states Ukraine's intention to reclaim all occupied territories, implying a speculative outcome where Russia loses control of these areas, directly aligning with the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sacked his top general.",
      "reasoning": "This statement speculates on the war's trajectory by highlighting Ukraine's struggles (e.g., failed counteroffensive, leadership changes) and Russia's strategic advantage, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting any specific subnarrative beyond general speculation about outcomes."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "The group’s assertion that in the U.S. most weather-related deaths ‘are caused by heat’ does not stand up to scrutiny, however, since the majority of weather-related deaths come from cold, not heat.",
      "reasoning": "This quote minimizes the significance of heat-related deaths and climate change impacts by emphasizing that cold-related deaths are more prevalent, thereby downplaying the urgency of climate change concerns."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "According to data published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), over the past twenty years annual heat-related deaths in the U.S. have ranged between 0.9 and 3.6 per million people whereas cold-related deaths have ranged between 3.6 and 5.9 per million people.",
      "reasoning": "This quote raises doubts about the scientific claims regarding heat-related deaths by presenting contrasting data, thereby questioning the validity of the measurements and assertions made by climate scientists."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Alarmists Warn of U.S. ‘Heat Dome’ Tied to Human-Induced Climate Change",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'alarmists' in the headline challenges the motives and integrity of those advocating for climate action, framing them as overly dramatic or exaggerated in their concerns."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the Lancet for allegedly overemphasizing climate change impacts, implying that the climate movement exaggerates or misrepresents scientific findings."

      "reasoning": "The quote emphasizes that cold-related deaths far outnumber heat-related deaths, implying that the temperature increase due to climate change does not have a significant negative impact on mortality rates."

      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that while there is a slight increase in heat-related deaths, the overall trend shows a greater decrease in cold-related deaths, implying that humans are adapting to temperature changes."

      "evidence_quote": "According to the Lancet, people around the world are 9.4 times more likely to die from the cold than from the heat. It added that over the past 20 years, the death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the impact of temperature increases (global warming) is minimal or offset by other factors, suggesting the data does not support a significant or alarming temperature-driven threat."

      "reasoning": "While this quote is part of the broader narrative questioning the science, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided. It supports the parent narrative by framing the original claims as alarmist without directly addressing methodologies, data, or the scientific community."

      "reasoning": "The headline and subsequent text frame climate activists and scientific warnings as 'alarmists,' suggesting they exaggerate the severity of climate change for dramatic effect. This directly aligns with the definition of the subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This argument undermines the credibility of climate movement claims by presenting counter-data (cold-related deaths outnumbering heat-related deaths) but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by criticizing the movement's factual basis without attacking individuals or alleging corruption."

      "reasoning": "This passage implies that the climate movement is politically motivated or biased, which aligns with the parent narrative but does not fit the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks. It suggests the movement's priorities are influenced by partisan agendas."

      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The text uses derogatory language ('radical', 'eco-loon') and highlights the disruptive nature of the activists' actions, which challenges the motives and integrity of the climate movement."

      "evidence_quote": "The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the activists' justification for their actions in a way that portrays the climate movement as alarmist or extreme, further criticizing their motives and impact."

      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The quote from the activist group's statement suggests an extreme and dramatic portrayal of climate change, which aligns with the subnarrative that the climate movement exaggerates the severity of climate issues for effect."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the Swedish Dance Show... The three activists jumped onto the stage, stood in front of the studio camera, released yellow paint powder, and unfurled a large banner... their stunt was short lived, with a large camera on a crane quickly swooping in and knocking down a male activist.",
      "reasoning": "The text describes the activists' actions as disruptive and radical, portraying them in a negative light by emphasizing the chaos and potential danger caused by their protest. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage during Sweden’s Strictly Come Dancing final over the weekend.",
      "reasoning": "The framing of the activists as 'radical' and the focus on the disruptive nature of their protest (storming a dance show) supports the parent narrative by portraying the climate movement as reckless or misguided, but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "I think that in this case it became dangerous because it happened in the middle of a dance where a heavily pregnant woman is participating.",
      "reasoning": "This quote emphasizes the perceived irresponsibility of the activists' actions, particularly in endangering a pregnant woman, which supports the parent narrative by implying the climate movement acts without regard for others, but does not fit a specific subnarrative definition."

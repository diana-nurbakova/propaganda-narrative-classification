      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely 'the hottest day in thousands of years.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'climate alarmists' is used pejoratively to challenge the motives and integrity of those advocating for climate action, implying they are exaggerating or sensationalizing the issue. This directly aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The text raises doubts about the scientific methods and data used to assert historical temperature records, specifically questioning the reliability of proxy records like tree rings and ice cores. This aligns with the narrative of questioning the measurements and science."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, 'scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,' NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly challenges the validity and comparability of proxy data used in climate science, reinforcing doubts about the scientific consensus and methods. This is a clear example of questioning the measurements and science."

      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This dismissive remark minimizes the significance of climate change findings by suggesting they are exaggerated or fabricated for dramatic effect, which aligns with the narrative of downplaying climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely 'the hottest day in thousands of years.' ... Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert that 2024 is 'the planet’s hottest year yet since at least the pre-industrial era, and likely for at least 100,000 years before that.'",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly labels climate advocates as 'alarmists' and critiques their claims as 'extravagant,' suggesting exaggeration of climate change severity for dramatic effect. This directly aligns with the definition of the subnarrative 'Climate movement is alarmist.'"

      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase undermines the credibility of climate science reporting by implying that the climate movement prioritizes sensationalism over factual accuracy. While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks,' thus qualifying for 'Other.'"

Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, 'scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,' NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the reliability of the methodologies and metrics used to estimate historical temperatures, particularly proxy records like tree rings and ice cores, by highlighting their fundamental differences from direct measurements and the lack of sufficient data before 1880."

      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'astonishing contentions' combined with the emphasis on the limited timeline of direct temperature data collection implies skepticism about the claims of record-breaking temperatures, suggesting that the data does not reliably support such assertions."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by implying that the claims of record temperatures are exaggerated or sensationalized, rather than being grounded in rigorous science. It does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions but clearly aligns with the broader theme of questioning the science."

      "reasoning": "The statement implies skepticism about claims of record-breaking temperatures by emphasizing the limited historical scope of direct temperature data collection, suggesting that assertions about temperatures over longer timescales (e.g., 100,000 years) are not supported by reliable data."

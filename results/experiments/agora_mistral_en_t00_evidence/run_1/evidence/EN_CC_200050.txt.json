    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act... the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, aligning with the definition of criticizing climate policies by highlighting potential negative consequences."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks... submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies skepticism or criticism of the Federal Reserve's involvement in climate-related financial regulations, challenging the competence or intentions of a key institution."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Deutsche bank in particular drew some criticism from activist groups that considered the move to be insufficient, since it did not include similar cutbacks in oil and gas... Activist groups had previously hailed the decision from major British bank HSBC in December to not fund new oil and gas investments",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the motives and expectations of climate activist groups, portraying them as overly demanding or inconsistent, which aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy... Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "While not explicit, the emphasis on banks aligning with global initiatives like the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance and shifting investments toward green energy can be interpreted as suggesting these policies are driven by broader geopolitical agendas rather than purely environmental concerns."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "(RELATED: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Shatter Record Despite Green Investments)",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly suggests that despite significant green investments, carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise, implying that climate policies (such as green investments) are not achieving their intended environmental goals."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that a rapid shift away from fossil fuels could harm the economy, particularly for developing nations, suggesting that climate policies may lead to negative economic outcomes."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021... The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote highlights the financial prioritization of green energy over fossil fuels, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives but still supports the parent narrative by implying that climate policies may be driving financial decisions without clear evidence of their effectiveness or economic neutrality."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Both banks are founding members of the United Nations’ Net Zero Banking Alliance, which requires its 126 members to set goals and disclose financial data related to their efforts to reduce the emissions of their lending portfolio to net zero by 2050.",
      "reasoning": "The text implicitly criticizes the influence of the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance by framing it as an external entity pressuring banks to adopt climate policies, which may be seen as overreach or coercion."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks — all named above — submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of the Federal Reserve's pilot program is framed as a governmental imposition on banks, which can be interpreted as criticism of national authorities for overregulating or interfering in financial institutions' decisions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes a specific political figure, Brad Lander, for pressuring banks through shareholder resolutions and threats, which aligns with discrediting political figures in the context of climate change debate."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021... The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote highlights the shift in banking investments toward green energy, it subtly supports the parent narrative by implying that banks are bowing to external pressures (e.g., climate activism) rather than making independent financial decisions. This does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but still criticizes institutional behavior."

      "evidence_quote": "Deutsche bank in particular drew some criticism from activist groups that considered the move to be insufficient, since it did not include similar cutbacks in oil and gas...",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting that the climate movement is portrayed as never satisfied with incremental progress, implying unreasonable demands. However, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, so it is classified as 'Other'."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that climate-related financial pressures are being used coercively, implying that international or institutional relations tied to climate policies are exploitative or abusive in nature, as they leverage financial threats to enforce compliance with green agendas."

      "evidence_quote": "the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This statement highlights the disparity between developed and developing nations, implying that green policies may disproportionately pressure or disadvantage developing countries, aligning with the idea that such policies are a form of neo-colonialism by imposing Western environmental standards on less-resourced nations."

      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks — all named above — submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by framing climate-related financial regulations as a tool of geopolitical or institutional control, but it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'abusive/exploitative relations' or 'neo-colonialism.' It suggests an overarching influence of green policies in shaping financial behavior, which aligns with the broader idea of green policies as geopolitical instruments."

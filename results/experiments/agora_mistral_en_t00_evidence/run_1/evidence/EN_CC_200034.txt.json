      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more \"greenhouse gases\" like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This statement minimizes the significance of human contributions to climate change by emphasizing natural sources of emissions, which fits the definition of downplaying climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote raises doubts about the scientific consensus and methods supporting the phase-out of fossil fuels, aligning with the narrative of questioning the measurements and science of climate change."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "If Just Stop Oil gets its way, the entire UK would lose the power and energy it needs to continue to exist, eventually leaving it destroyed and human-less.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the potential economic and societal impacts of climate policies (e.g., stopping oil use), which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "The UK electricity grid relies on natural gas as its 'buffer' energy source... renewables are highly variable and can only power the grid when gas is picking up the lion's share of the gap between their output and consumer demand.",

      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda. As the end of the biblical age of grace approaches, the world is increasingly coming unhinged, including environmentally as the birth pangs intensify. The theory that climate fanatics have adopted as to why this is all happening blames human activity and industry, even though the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the climate movement by implying they are misled by propaganda and hold irrational beliefs, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. It also includes a dismissive argument about natural sources of greenhouse gases, which is a common tactic in climate skepticism but not explicitly covered by the other subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote undermines the climate movement by questioning the competence and awareness of its members, suggesting they are fanatics with unrealistic goals. While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks on key activists."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly argues that human activities (e.g., car emissions, cattle farming) contribute negligibly to greenhouse gas emissions compared to natural sources like volcanoes, thereby supporting the subnarrative that human activities do not impact climate change."

      "reasoning": "This phrase directly challenges the notion of man-made climate change and promotes skepticism about its existence, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided. It serves as a remainder that reinforces the broader theme of downplaying climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the role of human activity and carbon dioxide in driving climate change, asserting that natural sources (volcanoes) emit more greenhouse gases than human sources, which aligns with the subnarrative definition."

      "reasoning": "This phrase broadly questions the validity of man-made climate change claims but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions. It supports the parent narrative by casting doubt on climate science without specifying a particular flaw in methodology, data, or the scientific community."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that climate policies targeting human activity and industry are misguided and ineffective because natural sources (e.g., volcanoes) contribute more to greenhouse gas emissions. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies fail to achieve their intended environmental goals."

Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that abruptly stopping oil and gas use would lead to catastrophic economic and societal collapse, directly supporting the subnarrative that climate policies have a negative impact on the economy and human survival."

      "reasoning": "This phrase frames climate activism as part of a broader, irrational apocalyptic narrative, which criticizes climate policies but does not fit the specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motives. It supports the parent narrative in a distinct way, warranting inclusion under 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This statement undermines the justification for transitioning away from fossil fuels by suggesting that human activity is not the primary contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.

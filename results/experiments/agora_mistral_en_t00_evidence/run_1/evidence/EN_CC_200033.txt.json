      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism. Run your eye down the contributors to The Climate Book and you can see who she’s been reading: Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Naomi Klein. For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the motives and integrity of Greta Thunberg and the broader climate movement, framing their goals as ideologically driven (anti-capitalism) rather than genuinely environmental. It aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement by questioning their true intentions."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the offshoot of which, Just Stop Oil, is currently engaged in blocking roads across London, admitted in his own words that his movement 'isn’t about the climate.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly criticizes the climate movement by highlighting a confession from a key figure that the movement's goals are not genuinely about climate change, thus challenging its integrity and impact."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a 'scam' which facilitates 'greenwashing, lying and cheating'.",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the competence and integrity of the COP (Conference of the Parties) institution, framing it as dishonest and ineffective, which aligns with the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the climate movement is a covert plot by powerful ideological groups (radical leftists) to advance their agenda under the guise of environmental concern, fitting the narrative of hidden plots by secret schemes."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The only solution to this state of emergency is for rich countries to immediately abandon economic expansion as a social goal.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the economic impact and feasibility of proposed climate policies (abandoning economic growth), aligning with the definition of criticizing climate policies."

      "reasoning": "The text describes Thunberg's rhetoric as 'extremist' and compares her to a 'climate Cassandra,' implying she exaggerates the severity of climate change for dramatic effect, which aligns with the definition of the subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "The text attacks Thunberg's reputation by calling her manifesto 'demented' and labeling her message as 'radical and militant,' which constitutes a direct ad hominem attack on a key activist."

[...] So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "The text argues that the climate movement's true goal is to dismantle Western capitalism and replace it with a far-left ideology, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions. This qualifies as a remainder under 'Other.'"

It suggests climate policies are a front for broader ideological goals, which is distinct from ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motives."

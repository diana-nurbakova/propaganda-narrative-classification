    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "The restructuring was completed in November 2015 with a swap into new bonds and GDP warrants. In December 2015, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved a moratorium on paying off $3 billion of Russian debt.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly praise Russia, the mention of the moratorium on Russian debt is framed in a way that indirectly acknowledges Russia's role as a creditor, which could be interpreted as a subtle normalization of Russia's position in the context of Ukraine's debt restructuring history."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Therefore, the $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs. At least $400 billion is needed to avoid loss.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the adequacy of Western financial assistance to Ukraine, implying that Western diplomatic and financial efforts are insufficient or misleading, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Western diplomacy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This statement predicts adverse outcomes for Western cities (e.g., destruction of hospitals) if Ukraine does not receive adequate support, which fits the narrative of highlighting negative consequences for the West."
    }
  ],
  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implicitly praises Russian military capabilities by framing them as a significant threat that requires substantial countermeasures, thereby emphasizing the scale and destructive power of Russia's military."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "While the text primarily criticizes Russia's actions, the mention of 'Russia’s initial invasion' as a historical fact without explicit condemnation in this context subtly reinforces Russia's perceived power and influence, aligning with the parent narrative but not fitting any specific subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Some believe that since Ukraine receives large amounts of international aid, it can be used to settle with bondholders. However, over two-thirds of financial assistance arrives as loans to be redeemed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western financial assistance to Ukraine is primarily self-serving (loans to be repaid) rather than altruistic, implying the West prioritizes its own financial interests over Ukraine's welfare. This aligns with the subnarrative that the West does not genuinely care about Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "The $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs. At least $400 billion is needed to avoid loss.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that the West's financial commitments to Ukraine are insufficient and that its assessments of Ukraine's needs are disproportionate or exaggerated, framing the West as either underestimating the situation or overreacting in its cautious approach."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Importantly, international assistance funds are intended to support Ukraine, its economy, and its military to withstand the war.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not directly fit any specific subnarrative, it subtly reinforces the parent narrative by implying that Western aid is conditional and transactional, rather than a genuine commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty or long-term stability. This residual evidence supports the broader theme of discrediting Western diplomacy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that if Ukraine does not receive sufficient financial support (including debt restructuring), the conflict could escalate and directly harm Western cities, implying that Western inaction or insufficient support could lead to negative consequences for the West itself. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western policies (or lack thereof) may backfire."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants. [...] Democracy and a just world order are the pillars of global economic sustainability, ensuring investment safety and security and investor profits worldwide.",
      "reasoning": "This broader argument frames Ukraine's struggle as essential to the stability and prosperity of the West, implying that failure to support Ukraine would undermine Western security, economic interests, and democratic values. While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided, thus qualifying for 'Other'."

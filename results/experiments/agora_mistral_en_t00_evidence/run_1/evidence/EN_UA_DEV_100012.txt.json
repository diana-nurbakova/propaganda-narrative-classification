      "evidence_quote": "Washington 'cannot afford' to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that the U.S. (and by extension, the West) is responsible for prolonging the conflict by prioritizing access to Ukraine's resources, shifting blame away from Russia's invasion."

      "evidence_quote": "'Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the legitimacy and character of Ukraine's government by labeling it as corrupt and neo-Nazi, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "While not directly about media, this footnote undermines the credibility of a Western figure by labeling him as a terrorist, which can contribute to a broader narrative of distrust toward Western institutions, including media."

'They’re sitting on 10 to $12 trillion of critical minerals in Ukraine. They could be the richest country in all of Europe,' Graham said. 'If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames the U.S. as pursuing its own economic and strategic interests in Ukraine, implying that the West is the true aggressor in the conflict by seeking to control Ukraine's resources rather than acknowledging Russia's role as the invader."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by further blaming the West for exploiting Ukraine and propping up a corrupt regime, but it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors.' Instead, it expands on the theme of Western culpability in a broader, less direct manner."

'If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames Western support for Ukraine as motivated by access to Ukraine's mineral resources rather than concern for Ukraine's sovereignty or well-being.

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by further discrediting the West's intentions, portraying it as exploitative and manipulative.

      "reasoning": "The text explicitly directs the reader to Sputnik's infographics, implying that Western media (e.g., CBS News) is not trustworthy or is distorting the narrative.

      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by implying that Western political figures (like Lindsey Graham) and their statements, as reported by Western media, are manipulative and self-serving.

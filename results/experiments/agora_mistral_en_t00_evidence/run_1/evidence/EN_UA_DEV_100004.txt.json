      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainian forces attempted to reach Russian territory with UAVs.",
      "reasoning": "This statement shifts focus to Ukrainian actions as a provocation or aggression, implying Ukraine is responsible for escalating the conflict rather than acknowledging Russia's invasion as the primary cause."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "the notorious Starokonstantinov airfield in the Khmelnitsk region. Ukrainian Su-24MR aircraft of the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade are based at there. They are the main carriers of Storm Shadow / SCALP cruise missiles.",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'notorious' to describe a Ukrainian airfield, combined with the emphasis on Ukrainian aircraft carrying missiles, subtly portrays Ukraine as an aggressive or threatening actor, undermining its legitimacy."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian forces continue massive strikes throughout Ukraine. [...] the Russian attack was successful [...] Russian strikes reportedly hit the Mirgorod airfield [...] Russian forces managed to advance from the recently captured ash dump and take control of the facilities on the northern outskirts of the large Coke and Chemical Plant.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the success and effectiveness of Russian military actions, portraying Russia's military as capable and advancing, which aligns with the narrative of praising Russia's strength and achievements."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainian aircraft armed with Storm Shadow missiles are taking off to attack Russian rear areas.",
      "reasoning": "While not explicitly criticizing the West, the mention of Storm Shadow missiles (supplied by Western countries) in the context of Ukrainian attacks subtly frames Western military support as enabling Ukrainian aggression, indirectly discrediting Western involvement."

More explosions thundered in the area of the notorious Starokonstantinov airfield in the Khmelnitsk region. Ukrainian Su-24MR aircraft of the 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade are based at there. They are the main carriers of Storm Shadow / SCALP cruise missiles.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for the conflict's escalation to the West by emphasizing that Ukrainian aircraft are using Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles to attack Russian territory, implying that the West is fueling the aggression rather than Russia being the instigator."

      "evidence_quote": "In their turn, Ukrainian forces attempted to reach Russian territory with UAVs. Overnight, two Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the Bryansk region, three more over the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea, the Russian Defense Ministry said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Ukraine as the aggressor by highlighting its drone attacks on Russian territory, thereby shifting responsibility for the conflict away from Russia and onto Ukraine."

      "evidence_quote": "Avdeevka, which was turned into a large stronghold by the Ukrainian military during the war in Donbass.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase subtly supports the parent narrative by implying that Ukraine fortified Avdeevka during the Donbass conflict, framing Ukraine as a long-standing aggressor in the region without explicitly blaming the West or Ukraine for the current war's initiation. It does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but still aligns with the broader goal of deflecting blame from Russia."

      "evidence_quote": "the local sources are hiding any information about the damage, but some supposed that another facility used for accommodation of Ukrainian servicemen was hit.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that Ukrainian military facilities are being targeted and that Ukrainian authorities are concealing information, which undermines the effectiveness and transparency of the Ukrainian armed forces."

      "evidence_quote": "The ongoing Russian operations in various directions from their stronghold in Krasnogorovka force the Ukrainian command to transfer additional reserves to the area in an attempt to replace those completely destroyed.",

      "reasoning": "This statement portrays a scenario where Ukrainian forces are being encircled and cut off from supplies, suggesting a dire and potentially hopeless military situation."

      "evidence_quote": "While heavy battles are ongoing on the frontlines, Russian forces continue massive strikes throughout Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase supports the parent narrative by emphasizing the scale and intensity of Russian military actions across Ukraine, contributing to a broader discrediting of Ukraine's ability to defend itself, but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative categories."

Russian forces managed to advance from the recently captured ash dump and take control of the facilities on the northern outskirts of the large Coke and Chemical Plant.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the scale, effectiveness, and strategic success of Russian military operations, including strikes on Ukrainian airfields and advances in Avdeevka. This directly aligns with the definition of praising Russia’s military institutions, equipment, and operational capabilities."

Ukrainian forces attempted to reach Russian territory with UAVs... two Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the Bryansk region, three more over the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea",
      "reasoning": "The text emphasizes the success of Russian attacks while downplaying Ukrainian efforts (e.g., drone strikes being intercepted) and framing Russian actions as precise (no civilian casualties). This supports the parent narrative of praising Russia but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions."

      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, the Russian army is developing its offensive in Avdeevka, which was turned into a large stronghold by the Ukrainian military during the war in Donbass. According to preliminary reports from the front, Russian forces managed to advance from the recently captured ash dump and take control of the facilities on the northern outskirts of the large Coke and Chemical Plant.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights Russian military advances and the capture of strategic positions, implying that Western-backed Ukrainian forces are unable to effectively resist or counter Russian offensives, thus portraying the West as militarily ineffective and weak in supporting Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "The focus on Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles and their use by Ukraine suggests that the West is only providing weapons to Ukraine for its own strategic interests (e.g., weakening Russia) rather than genuinely caring about Ukraine's sovereignty or well-being."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by implying that Western-backed Ukrainian forces are being overwhelmed and depleted, suggesting the West's support is insufficient or ineffective.

According to preliminary reports from the front, Russian forces managed to advance from the recently captured ash dump and take control of the facilities on the northern outskirts of the large Coke and Chemical Plant.",
      "reasoning": "The text does not explicitly predict Russian loss of occupied territories, but the detailed description of Russian advances and tactical gains (e.g., capturing facilities, cutting supply roads) implicitly counters the subnarrative of Russian forces losing control. However, the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes is present, and this quote could be interpreted as setting the stage for future speculation about territorial control. Given the lack of direct evidence for this subnarrative, it is a weaker fit but still relevant in the broader context of war outcome speculation."

      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on potential future outcomes of the conflict, specifically the tactical advantages Russian forces might gain. While it does not fit the specific subnarratives of Russian or Ukrainian collapse or loss of occupied territories, it clearly supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes by predicting possible developments in the conflict."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines Ukraine's legitimacy by emphasizing its corruption, aligning with the definition of discrediting Ukraine as a nation and its governance."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes a prominent Western journalist and, by extension, Western media and institutions, suggesting they are unreliable or biased, which fits the narrative of discrediting the West."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "This thinly sourced statement, however, skims over the complexities of a very nuanced war. It is not a statement that can exist without a deeper explanation–and that explanation takes the wind out of the sails of a very damaging allegation.",
      "reasoning": "The text questions the reliability of Hersh's claims and implies that media statements can be misleading or lack context, fostering distrust in media narratives."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote predicts adverse outcomes for the U.S. (e.g., reduced public support for Ukraine), which aligns with the narrative of highlighting negative consequences for Western interests."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly targets the Ukrainian government and its officials by portraying them as inherently corrupt, aligning with the subnarrative's definition of delegitimizing the government and its policies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities",
      "evidence_quote": "The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Ukraine is a center for fraud and illicit activities, particularly in the context of war profiteering and weapons diversion, which fits the subnarrative of portraying Ukraine as a hub for criminal activities."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by implying that Ukraine's corruption undermines Western support, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It focuses on the broader impact of discrediting Ukraine rather than a specific aspect like government, military, or society."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly states that Western (specifically U.S.) support for Ukraine is not motivated by concern for Ukraine itself but rather by self-interested geopolitical considerations, aligning with the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "From this perspective, the shock and awe over the level of war-time corruption seems misplaced.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase suggests that Western reactions to corruption in Ukraine are disproportionate or exaggerated, which fits the subnarrative of the West overreacting to Russia’s actions or associated issues."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by implying that Western (U.S.) support for Ukraine is waning due to corruption, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It suggests a broader discrediting of Western resolve without directly claiming fatigue, division, or weakness."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The text discredits a Western journalist by claiming he spreads 'Russian propaganda' and implies his reporting is unreliable, which aligns with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This thinly sourced statement, however, skims over the complexities of a very nuanced war. It is not a statement that can exist without a deeper explanation–and that explanation takes the wind out of the sails of a very damaging allegation.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes Hersh's reporting as 'thinly sourced' and suggests it is misleading without proper context, which supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives. This phrase implies that media narratives (even from non-Western or alternative sources) are unreliable or manipulative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly suggests that Western support for Ukraine (including sanctions and aid) may weaken due to corruption revelations, implying that Western policies could backfire by eroding public and political will to continue backing Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Does learning that this isn’t the Disney version of war and that the side the West is fighting for is simply the lesser corrupt among the two parties mean we should soften support for Ukraine’s war effort? Does learning that there may have been contract fraud along the chain from the U.S. to Ukraine mean we should withdraw and let Putin do as Putin will?",
      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative by framing Western support for Ukraine as potentially unsustainable or morally compromised due to corruption, which could lead to negative consequences for the West (e.g., weakened alliances or strategic setbacks). However, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, hence the use of 'Other'."

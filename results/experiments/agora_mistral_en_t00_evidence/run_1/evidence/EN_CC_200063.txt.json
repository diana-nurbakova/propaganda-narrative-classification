      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The SEC must stop overreaching in this area and allow private ordering under corporate law to reestablish shareholder proposals as ways to enhance economic efficiency rather than diminish it.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the SEC's regulatory approach to shareholder proposals related to climate change, arguing that it diminishes economic efficiency. This directly questions the effectiveness and economic impact of climate policies, fitting the definition of 'Criticism of climate policies'."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the competence and integrity of the SEC, an institution, by describing its regulatory approach as 'arguably lawless'. This aligns with the definition of 'Criticism of institutions and authorities'."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The shareholder proposal process has gone too far. How else to interpret the proposal recently sponsored by the climate activist investors Arjuna Capital and Follow This at ExxonMobil...",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the motives and impact of climate activist investors (part of the climate movement), framing their actions as overreach. This fits the definition of 'Criticism of climate movement'."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "The text suggests that the climate-related shareholder proposal is a result of regulatory overreach by the SEC, implying that such policies do not achieve their intended goals of improving corporate governance or environmental outcomes but instead create inefficiencies and legal disputes."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly states that implementing the climate proposal would force ExxonMobil to abandon a major economic investment and reduce its operations, highlighting the perceived negative economic consequences of climate policies."

      "evidence_quote": "We argue that the SEC must stop overreaching in this area and allow private ordering under corporate law to reestablish shareholder proposals as ways to enhance economic efficiency rather than diminish it.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes climate-related shareholder proposals as diminishing economic efficiency, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It emphasizes regulatory overreach and economic concerns without directly addressing profit motives or policy ineffectiveness."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the SEC (a political organization) for its regulatory approach, discrediting its role in the shareholder proposal process and framing it as overreaching and unlawful."

      "evidence_quote": "We argue that the SEC must stop overreaching in this area and allow private ordering under corporate law to reestablish shareholder proposals as ways to enhance economic efficiency rather than diminish it.",
      "reasoning": "While this statement also criticizes the SEC, it extends beyond the specific discrediting of political organizations to a broader argument about institutional overreach and inefficiency, which does not neatly fit the defined subnarratives but still supports the parent narrative."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that the climate movement's demands are exaggerated and unrealistic, implying that the proposed emission reduction targets are alarmist and would lead to extreme, impractical consequences for the company."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement's influence on regulatory processes, alleging overreach and misuse of the shareholder proposal system. While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks, thus qualifying as 'Other'."

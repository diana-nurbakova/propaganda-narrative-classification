      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the actions and decisions of the German government and authorities, challenging their competence and integrity in handling the coal mine expansion and climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Interactions between the activists and police have grown violent at times, resulting in the hospitalizations of at least nine demonstrators.",
      "reasoning": "This statement indirectly challenges the impact and methods of the climate movement by highlighting the negative consequences (violence and hospitalizations) of their protests, which could be interpreted as undermining their legitimacy or effectiveness."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the German government's actions and decisions, specifically in the context of climate policy and the handling of the coal mine expansion, aligning with the definition of disapproval of national governments' handling of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Police told the BBC they arrested Thunberg and others after they “rushed towards the ledge” of the mine. All will be released without charges after their identities are checked, police said.",
      "reasoning": "The description of police actions and the portrayal of law enforcement's handling of the protest implicitly discredits the political and institutional figures responsible for these decisions, fitting the subnarrative of criticizing political organizations and figures in the climate change debate."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "She and other activists say expanding the coal mine would contribute to the climate crisis and be counterproductive to Germany’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the broader institutional and governmental approach to climate policy (e.g., approving coal expansion despite climate commitments), which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Video captured at the protest showed three officers carrying a seemingly unbothered Thunberg, 20, away from the demonstration...",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'seemingly unbothered' subtly undermines Greta Thunberg's commitment and sincerity, implying she is not genuinely concerned about the protest or its cause. This attacks her reputation rather than addressing the substance of her activism."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Interactions between the activists and police have grown violent at times, resulting in the hospitalizations of at least nine demonstrators.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by portraying the climate movement as disruptive and associated with violence, without directly fitting the definitions of the other subnarratives. It implies the movement is problematic or irresponsible, aligning with broader criticism of the climate movement."

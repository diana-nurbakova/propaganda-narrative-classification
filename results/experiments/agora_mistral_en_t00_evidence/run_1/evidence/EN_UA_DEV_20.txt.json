      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia by suggesting that the U.S. and U.K. are responsible for sabotaging a potential peace deal, thereby prolonging the conflict."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv. The Ukrainians have, so far, been able to prevent the Russians from advancing and seizing all the territory that Moscow now claims. But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine’s military capabilities and portrays its forces as weak and unsustainable, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Ukraine."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western and U.S. actions as reckless and counterproductive, aligning with the narrative of discrediting the West and its diplomatic efforts."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This quote predicts severe negative consequences (e.g., nuclear escalation) as a result of Western actions, fitting the narrative of highlighting adverse outcomes for the West and the world."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the continuation of the war onto the U.S. and U.K., portraying them as the ones who sabotaged a potential peace deal, thereby framing the West as the aggressors prolonging the conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the Ukrainian government and its Western backers for escalating the conflict, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It reinforces the idea that the war is being prolonged by external actors rather than the invader (Russia)."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained. Recently, the Russians even launched a brand new incursion into territory around the northeastern city of Kharkiv—territory that had already been recaptured by the Ukrainians in late 2022. Russia’s minefields, artillery, and punishing glide bombs have not only kept Ukrainian forces from advancing but left them struggling to hold their positions along the current front line.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by highlighting their failures in the counteroffensive, territorial losses, and inability to hold positions against Russian advances."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law that sought to boost conscription rates by making it easier for the government to find and identify draft-eligible men. But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays the Ukrainian government as desperate and heavy-handed in its policies, particularly regarding conscription, which delegitimizes its leadership and decision-making."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly claims that Ukraine is being controlled or heavily influenced by Western powers (the UK and US), who dictated its decision to continue fighting rather than negotiate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv. The Ukrainians have, so far, been able to prevent the Russians from advancing and seizing all the territory that Moscow now claims. But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Ukraine as having no viable path to success, emphasizing its dwindling resources and inability to sustain its military efforts, which aligns with the subnarrative of a hopeless situation."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What makes Ukraine’s situation even more tragic is how easily it could have been avoided. One month after Russia invaded in early 2022, both sides reached an agreement where Russia would pull back to preinvasion boundaries and, in return, Ukraine would agree to not seek NATO membership. The deal could have put an end to the fighting and handed Kyiv control of all the land Russia had just seized.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by implying that Ukraine's leadership made poor decisions (e.g., rejecting a favorable deal) that worsened its situation, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided. Thus, it qualifies for 'Other'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations. President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia... All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly frames Western actions (e.g., allowing Ukraine to strike inside Russia, nuclear ICBM tests) as unnecessary, disproportionate, and dangerous escalations, which aligns with the definition of 'The West is overreacting.'"
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that the U.S. and U.K. prioritized their own strategic interests (e.g., weakening Russia) over Ukraine's immediate well-being by sabotaging a peace deal that could have ended the war early, fitting the subnarrative that the West disregards Ukraine's fate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies that Western leaders are unwilling to engage in meaningful diplomacy, instead pursuing military escalation, which discredits the potential of diplomatic efforts. This aligns with the subnarrative that 'Diplomacy does/will not work.'"

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The West’s chosen depiction of Putin as a tyrant bent on conquering the entire European continent suffered its latest setback last month when it came out that the Russian president is interested in halting the fighting and negotiating a deal that recognizes the current battlefield lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines the West's narrative about Putin's intentions but does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western diplomatic framing of Russia, warranting inclusion under 'Other.'"
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western sanctions or policies aimed at weakening Russia have not achieved their intended effect. Instead, Russia has adapted and increased its war-related production, implying that Western measures are ineffective or counterproductive, aligning with the subnarrative that sanctions will backfire."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting the broader negative consequences of Western involvement in the conflict, such as increased global instability and the risk of nuclear escalation. However, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, so it is classified under 'Other'."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly warns that continued escalation in the conflict risks a catastrophic nuclear accident, which aligns with the fear of triggering a broader, potentially world-ending conflict (WWIII)."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden then renewed one of his favorite tropes, asserting that if Ukraine falls, its people will be subjugated, its neighbors will be in immediate danger, and all of Europe will be threatened by Putin’s aggressive ambitions.",
      "reasoning": "The quote claims that Russia's aggression will not stop at Ukraine but will extend to neighboring countries and all of Europe, directly supporting the subnarrative that Russia will attack other countries."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia conducted drills simulating the use of strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus and has sent warships and a submarine to the Caribbean. The Russians have also stepped up shelling and airstrikes in Ukraine in response to the strikes on their territory.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of Russia conducting nuclear drills and the broader context of escalating tensions evokes fear of nuclear weapons being employed, fitting the subnarrative definition."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia.",
      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that NATO is already taking direct action by allowing its weapons to be used for strikes inside Russia, implying a shift toward direct intervention in the conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "the US then test-fired two nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles—launching them four thousand miles from California to the Marshall Islands.",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by highlighting provocative military actions (nuclear missile tests) that could escalate tensions, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided. Thus, it supports the parent narrative under 'Other'."

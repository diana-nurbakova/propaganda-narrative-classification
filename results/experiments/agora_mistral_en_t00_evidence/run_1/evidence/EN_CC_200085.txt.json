    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title itself frames the wind energy initiative as a 'ripoff,' implying that the climate policy (offshore wind energy development) is ineffective, wasteful, or economically harmful. This directly questions the value and motives behind climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'ripoff' in the title suggests skepticism or criticism of wind energy technology, portraying it as flawed or overhyped. This aligns with the narrative of expressing skepticism about environmentally friendly technologies."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff… The lease sale represents the third major offshore wind lease sale this year and the first ever for the Pacific region. Today’s sale drew competitive high bids from 5 companies totaling $757.1 million, well exceeding the first lease sales that were held in the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'ripoff' and the emphasis on the high monetary value of the bids ($757.1 million) suggest that the policy is driven by financial gain for companies rather than genuine environmental concerns. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies are only for profit."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The framing of the wind energy initiative as a 'ripoff' implies that the policy is wasteful or detrimental to economic interests, suggesting a negative economic impact. This supports the subnarrative that climate policies harm the economy."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The overarching tone of the headline and the dismissive framing of the policy as a 'ripoff' without further elaboration in the provided text supports the parent narrative of criticism of climate policies but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. This justifies the inclusion of 'Other'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "The lease sale represents the third major offshore wind lease sale this year and the first ever for the Pacific region. Today’s sale drew competitive high bids from 5 companies totaling $757.1 million, well exceeding the first lease sales that were held in the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights the high financial cost of offshore wind energy leases, implying that renewable energy (specifically wind) is expensive, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title itself frames the entire announcement as a 'ripoff,' suggesting a broader critique of green technologies (specifically wind energy) that does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but clearly supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies."

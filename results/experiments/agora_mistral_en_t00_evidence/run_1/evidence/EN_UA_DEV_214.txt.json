      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the war in Ukraine away from Russia (the invader) and toward China, implying that China is responsible for enabling the conflict rather than acknowledging Russia's role as the aggressor."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto the West, portraying the West as the primary aggressor by framing their military support for Ukraine as the root cause of the conflict. It also dismisses Western narratives about China's role, reinforcing the idea that the West is responsible for escalation."

While it does not fit the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West as direct aggressors in Ukraine, it still shifts responsibility away from Russia by portraying the West as the instigator of a global war."

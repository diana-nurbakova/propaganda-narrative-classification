      "reasoning": "This quote highlights criticism directed at the UK Prime Minister's decision-making and competence, suggesting internal and external challenges to his authority and judgment regarding climate policy attendance."

      "evidence_quote": "Sunak has been sending mixed signals about his government’s energy and climate policies. The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the consistency and effectiveness of Sunak's climate policies, implying a lack of clear direction and undermining confidence in the government's approach to climate issues."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The U-turn comes after Sunak came under pressure from climate activists... for his planned absence.",

But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote discredits Sunak and his government's inconsistent climate policies and decisions, such as demoting key climate figures, which fits the subnarrative of criticizing political figures in the context of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests uncertainty about the feasibility and effectiveness of the policy, implying that the outcomes (e.g., cost, practicality) are not guaranteed to achieve the intended environmental goals."

      "evidence_quote": "Ford announced that it was already cutting job and investment projections for the project.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a negative economic outcome (job cuts and reduced investment) linked to climate-related projects, supporting the subnarrative that climate policies harm the economy."

Gotion Inc., linked to the CCP, plans to build a $2.4 billion EV battery plant in the Big Rapids, Michigan, area at Whitmer’s behest.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the policy is driven by financial or corporate interests (e.g., partnerships with CCP-linked companies) rather than purely environmental concerns, aligning with the subnarrative that climate policies are profit-driven."

      "evidence_quote": "The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the policy by highlighting public opposition and political consequences, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives. It suggests broader discontent with climate policies beyond the defined categories."

Gotion Inc., linked to the CCP, plans to build a $2.4 billion EV battery plant in the Big Rapids, Michigan, area at Whitmer’s behest. The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",

(CATL) — China’s premiere battery supplier with deep ties to the CCP. Most recently, Ford announced that it was already cutting job and investment projections for the project.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the state government's handling of climate-related investments, specifically the involvement of foreign entities with CCP ties and the apparent failure of the project, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. Thus, it qualifies for 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This section introduces controversy about the geopolitical and local political implications of green technology investments, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit into the predefined subnarratives. It suggests potential risks and unpopularity associated with green technology adoption, warranting inclusion under 'Other'."

(CATL) — China’s premiere battery supplier with deep ties to the CCP.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames Michigan's green energy investments as entanglements with Chinese corporations tied to the CCP, portraying them as exploitative and abusive. The mention of taxpayer subsidies and local political backlash reinforces the idea that these climate-related international relations are economically and politically harmful to the state and its citizens."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "Michigan is on the cutting-edge of mobility and electrification. Our world-leading auto industry is making the switch to electric, and we continue to attract battery, semiconductor, and clean energy investments from other states and nations. We must usher the future of mobility and clean energy into Michigan by winning projects and leading by example in state government.",
      "reasoning": "While not as explicit as the first subnarrative, the emphasis on Michigan 'attracting' investments from other nations and 'winning projects' subtly frames green policies as a means for external entities (e.g., Chinese-linked corporations) to exert influence and control over Michigan's industrial and economic landscape. This aligns with the neo-colonialism subnarrative by implying a dynamic where developed or foreign powers shape local policies and economies under the guise of green initiatives."

      "evidence_quote": "The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting the potential economic burden of green policies on taxpayers without clear benefits, suggesting that such policies may serve ulterior geopolitical or economic agendas rather than purely environmental goals. This argument does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but still reinforces the idea that green policies are instruments of broader, potentially exploitative strategies."

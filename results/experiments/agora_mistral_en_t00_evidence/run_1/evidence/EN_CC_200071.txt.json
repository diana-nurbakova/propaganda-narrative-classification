      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "The statement directly criticizes the economic impact of climate policies, specifically targeting their role in increasing housing costs, which aligns with the definition of questioning the effectiveness and economic consequences of climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly blames green policies for rising costs of essentials, reinforcing the narrative of criticizing climate policies for their negative economic effects."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that 'lower greenhouse gas emissions' and fight the so-called 'climate crisis.'",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'so-called climate crisis' and the framing of the program as an imposition challenge the competence and intentions of the Biden administration and its institutions, fitting the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses skepticism and criticism of wind, solar, and biomass energy, directly aligning with the narrative of controversy about green technologies."

      "evidence_quote": "BLINDED by MONEY: Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'green cult' and the accusation of ignoring environmental harm while profiting financially challenge the motives and integrity of the climate movement, fitting the definition of criticism of the climate movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that green policies may weaken the U.S. in a geopolitical context, implying they could be tools for undermining national strength rather than genuine environmental concern, aligning with the narrative of green policies as geopolitical instruments."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that climate policies are causing financial hardship for average Americans, specifically mentioning unaffordable housing, gasoline, and utility bills, which aligns with the definition of negative economic outcomes."

These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that renewable energy sources promoted by climate policies are inefficient, unable to meet energy demands, and environmentally destructive, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended goals."

This additional spending for owners of houses and residential buildings comes at a period in the United States when families are already struggling to afford a home.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies, it does not neatly fit the specific subnarratives of 'ineffective,' 'negative economic impact,' or 'only for profit.' It focuses on the burden of compliance costs and timing of policy implementation, which is distinct from the other subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies, it focuses on the financial burden of specific regulatory measures (e.g., building codes) rather than fitting neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It highlights the economic strain but does not explicitly claim ineffectiveness or profit motives."

      "reasoning": "The text explicitly criticizes the Biden administration and its Department of Energy for implementing policies that are portrayed as harmful to the affordability of housing for Americans. This directly disapproves of how the national government is handling climate change policies."

'To allegedly save us all from a \"climate crisis,\"' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted...",
      "reasoning": "The text discredits President Biden and his administration by framing his 'globalist green agenda' as misguided and harmful. The use of a conservative think tank fellow to critique Biden further emphasizes the criticism of political figures and their policies."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "State and local governments that take advantage of the Biden administration's funding for implementing green building codes would further be spurred to eventually phase out the use of natural gas in homes and residential buildings – which could make energy costs even more expensive as cheap natural gas disappears.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the broader institutional approach to climate policy (e.g., state and local governments adopting federal incentives) but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It highlights systemic issues beyond just national government or political figures."

      "reasoning": "The text explicitly states that renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass are 'inefficient and expensive,' directly aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly. It also highlights the financial burden on homeowners and developers due to green policies, reinforcing the claim that these technologies are not cost-effective for widespread adoption."

      "evidence_quote": "cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper... 'zero energy' building codes, which will require residential buildings to install small-scale renewable energy generators 'to achieve zero-net carbon.'",
      "reasoning": "The text argues that renewable energy sources 'cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy' required, which directly supports the subnarrative that renewable energy is unreliable for meeting energy demands. The mention of 'zero-net carbon' requirements further implies that renewables are insufficient on their own."

Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations.",
      "reasoning": "The text claims that renewable energy sources are 'far more destructive to the environment' and highlights specific dangers such as pollution from mining and harm to wildlife (eagles and whales). This directly aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is dangerous."

John Kerry admits NUCLEAR ENERGY is necessary but continues to push for wind and solar instead... IRONIC? Tesla is building the world's largest supercharger station, but it's powered by a diesel power plant.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the slowdown of hydroelectric and nuclear energy development, as well as the inconsistency in promoting wind and solar over nuclear despite its acknowledged necessity. Additionally, the irony of a diesel-powered supercharger station undermines the credibility of green technology initiatives. These points support the parent narrative but do not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the practicality and effectiveness of green energy policies, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the provided specific subnarratives. It implies that the climate movement's solutions are flawed, which is a distinct argument beyond alarmism or corruption."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement by implying it prioritizes financial gain over environmental realities, supporting the parent narrative. However, it does not fit the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks, as it focuses on environmental harm and financial motives without directly alleging corruption or attacking individuals."

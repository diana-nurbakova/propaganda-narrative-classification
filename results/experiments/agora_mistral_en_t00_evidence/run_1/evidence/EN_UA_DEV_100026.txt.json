      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for Germany's economic struggles away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and instead attributes the negative consequences to Western sanctions and the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines, implying the West is responsible for the crisis."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error. While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western (specifically German) leadership and policies, portraying them as incompetent, hypocritical, and self-destructive while contrasting them with the pragmatic approaches of non-Western countries like China."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The German economy, the fourth-largest in the world, has ground to a standstill. There is no growth. Manufacturing is depressed, trade is weak, inflation is high, and jobs are scarce. Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights the adverse economic outcomes for Germany (a Western nation), emphasizing recession, inflation, and job scarcity as direct consequences of its energy policies and external factors like sanctions."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Virtue-Signaling Straight Into the Abyss... While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "While not explicitly targeting media, the phrase 'virtue-signaling' implies a broader distrust of narratives promoted by Western institutions, including media, which are portrayed as out of touch with reality and driven by ideological agendas."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "facing intense pressure from green politicians and evangelists of a looming climate apocalypse, Germany embarked on a plan to completely eliminate coal and other fossil fuels from its energy complex.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Germany's energy policies were influenced by hidden agendas or secret schemes of powerful groups (e.g., 'green politicians and evangelists') pushing a climate apocalypse narrative, implying manipulation rather than genuine concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for Germany's economic struggles onto the 'sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West,' portraying the West as the aggressors responsible for the conflict's consequences rather than Russia, the invader."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s beleaguered citizens appear to have had enough of this disaster. Political change is in the winds. The populist conservative party, Alternative for Germany, has just emerged as Germany’s second strongest party, polling at 20 percent support nationwide and more than one-third in some regions. One of the party’s main selling points is that it’s 'an aggressive opponent of the government’s energy and climate policy.'",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not directly blame Ukraine or the West, it frames the war's economic fallout as a consequence of domestic policy failures and misguided leadership, indirectly supporting the parent narrative by deflecting responsibility away from Russia's invasion and onto other factors (e.g., German energy policy). This does not fit the specific subnarratives but still aligns with the broader theme of shifting blame."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights disparities among EU nations in their economic suffering due to energy policies and sanctions, implying division within the EU regarding how to handle the crisis and its consequences."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany has just recorded its third consecutive quarter of recession, marked by negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The central bank expects the rest of the year to be no better.",
      "reasoning": "The description of Germany's economic decline, framed as a result of Western policies (sanctions and green energy transitions), portrays the West as economically weakened and ineffective in managing its own stability."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing. As a result, Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies that the West's sanctions on Russia (ostensibly to support Ukraine) have backfired, prioritizing geopolitical posturing over the well-being of its own citizens, suggesting self-interest over genuine concern for Ukraine."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the sanctions regime as ineffective and counterproductive, implying that diplomatic efforts (or their outcomes) have failed to achieve their intended goals and instead caused harm to Western economies."

      "evidence_quote": "While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by contrasting the West's (specifically Germany's) self-destructive policies with the pragmatic approaches of other global powers, implying the West's moral and strategic failure without fitting neatly into the predefined subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes Germany's economic struggles to the sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries, suggesting that these sanctions have led to negative consequences for Germany, such as higher energy costs and economic instability. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western sanctions will backfire."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting the broader negative economic consequences for Western nations (Germany and Italy) due to their reliance on Russian gas and the subsequent geopolitical conflict. While it does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'sanctions backfiring' or 'refugee flows,' it clearly illustrates negative consequences for the West, warranting the use of 'Other.'"

      "reasoning": "The text implies that Western (including German) media and leadership are promoting a misleading or hypocritical narrative about climate policy, suggesting they are instruments of propaganda that ignore the economic realities and the actions of other major emitters like China. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The proposed solution of German leaders has been for its citizens to consume less and its factories to produce less or move manufacturing offshore. But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders?",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the narrative promoted by Western leaders and media without directly targeting Ukrainian media or explicitly labeling Western media as propaganda. It supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by implying that the information or policies being pushed are misguided or deceptive, but it does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Germany's economic struggles are not merely the result of its own policies but are instead driven by hidden agendas or deliberate actions by powerful external groups (e.g., the U.S. and the West imposing sanctions, or the sabotage of Nord Stream). This aligns with the parent narrative of hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups, but it does not fit a more specific subnarrative, hence classified as 'Other'."

This supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by secret schemes, but it does not fit a more specific subnarrative, so it is classified as 'Other'."

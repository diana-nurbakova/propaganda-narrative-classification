      "evidence_quote": "It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the motives and integrity of the climate movement by suggesting that their actions (e.g., in-person summits) are unnecessary and wasteful, undermining their stated goals."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",

      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti joined a U.S. Department of Transportation presentation on 'high-quality urban transportation infrastructure,' though L.A.’s infrastructure is not widely considered 'high-quality.' A proposed high-speed rail between L.A. and San Francisco has been largely canceled, and current passenger rail service from L.A. to San Diego has been suspended because of a potential landslide hazard.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights the discrepancy between Garcetti's advocacy for climate solutions at an international summit and the perceived failure of local infrastructure projects, suggesting that climate policies are not achieving their intended goals."

      "evidence_quote": "burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home... It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes the hypocrisy of attending an in-person climate summit while contributing to carbon emissions, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other subnarratives. Additionally, the focus on Garcetti's absence from local issues (e.g., crime, homelessness) further critiques the prioritization of climate policies over immediate local concerns."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the U.S. national government and its agencies (e.g., Department of Transportation) for failing to deliver on infrastructure promises, which is tied to climate policy and governance. This fits the subnarrative of disapproving national governments' handling of climate-related issues."

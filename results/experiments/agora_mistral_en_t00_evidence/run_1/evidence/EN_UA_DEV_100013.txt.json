      "evidence_quote": "Zaluzhny is a fitting representative, with blood on his hands. That he was appointed ambassador to the UK in March confirms the SEP’s insistence that a major escalation of NATO’s proxy war against Russia is being prepared.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly attacks the legitimacy and moral character of a high-ranking Ukrainian official, Zaluzhny, by accusing him of having 'blood on his hands' and associating him with criminality. This undermines Ukraine's government and military leadership."

With Labour preparing to implement a major escalation of the war following a scheduled NATO conference on July 9-12, Zaluzhny can and must play a key role.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western political leadership (Labour Party and NATO) for preparing to escalate the war, implying incompetence or malice in their foreign policy decisions."

The SBU secret service are attempting to frame Bogdan, a Trotskyist opponent of NATO’s proxy war, the Zelensky regime and of Russia’s invasion, as a supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "reasoning": "The quote shifts blame for the conflict by framing it as 'NATO’s proxy war,' implying that NATO, rather than Russia, is primarily responsible for the invasion and ongoing conflict."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the UK's appointment of Zaluzhny as ambassador is driven by its own strategic interests in escalating the war against Russia, rather than any genuine concern for Ukraine's well-being or democratic processes.

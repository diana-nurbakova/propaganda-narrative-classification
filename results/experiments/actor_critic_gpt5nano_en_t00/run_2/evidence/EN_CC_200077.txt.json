      "reasoning": "The quotes present broad, critical framing of green-energy policies as benefiting corporations and foreign interests, include coercive policy elements (eminent domain, zoning overrides), and describe the strategy as a scam. These elements support the parent narrative CC: Controversy about green technologies but do not map to any of the more specific subnarratives (danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear climate-friendliness), so they are categorized as 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "The piece explicitly challenges the core scientific claim and cites data from EPA and Lancet to counter the assertion, signaling skepticism toward the measurements and consensus presented."

      "evidence_quote": "heat-related deaths are rising as heat waves like this one occur more regularly thanks to worsening human-induced climate change.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence directly ties rising heat-related deaths to human-caused climate change and increasing heat waves, exemplifying the propagation and intensification of fears about global warming."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly challenges the claim that heat dominates weather-related mortality by presenting data indicating that cold deaths are more prevalent, thereby undermining the measurements/claims about temperature-related deaths."

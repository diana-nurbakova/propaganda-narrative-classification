      "reasoning": "The sentence explicitly accuses the Ukrainian government and its Western backers of escalating the war through 'risky, strategically pointless provocations,' undermining Ukraine's legitimacy and actions."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "\"The West’s chosen depiction of Putin as a tyrant bent on conquering the entire European continent suffered its latest setback last month when it came out that the Russian president is interested in halting the fighting and negotiating a deal that recognizes the current battlefield lines.\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote critiques Western portrayals of Putin and frames diplomacy as preferable, undermining Western diplomacy and support for Ukraine."

      "evidence_quote": "\"So, accepting Russia’s offer to move this conflict from the battlefield to the negotiation table is almost certainly the best chance Ukraine will get to hold onto the eastern territory they still control.\"",
      "reasoning": "This line makes a probabilistic projection about future outcomes, presenting negotiation as the best chance and thereby engaging in outcome speculation."

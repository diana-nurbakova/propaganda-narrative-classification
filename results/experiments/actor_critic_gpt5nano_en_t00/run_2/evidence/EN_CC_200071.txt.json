      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted,",
      "reasoning": "The language casts climate concerns as an urgent crisis used to justify halting traditional energy sources, signaling alarmism."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.",
      "reasoning": "The claim casts wind, solar, and biomass as inferior and costly, expressing skepticism toward green tech."

      "evidence_quote": "Biden's \"globalist green agenda.\"",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly characterizes the climate policy as a 'globalist green agenda,' attributing it to powerful global elites. This aligns with blaming global elites as the driver behind climate action."

      "reasoning": "The passage accuses donors and a 'green cult' of manipulating opinion for money, implying a conspiratorial influence by powerful actors. It does not clearly map to the specific subnarrative definitions, so it fits the broader 'Other' category."

      "reasoning": "This line contributes to a climate-scare narrative by alleging corruption and manipulation within climate-related movements, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "BLINDED by MONEY: Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations.",
      "reasoning": "Claims about wind farms harming wildlife suggest dangers or negative environmental impacts associated with renewable energy technologies."

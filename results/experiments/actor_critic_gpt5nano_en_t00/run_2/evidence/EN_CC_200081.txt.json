      "reasoning": "The quote questions the actions and competence of political authorities and their handling of wind-energy projects."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business. Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses public concerns about environmental and local economic impacts of wind-energy development, aligning with the parent narrative of climate-policy criticism while not fitting the other specific subnarratives."

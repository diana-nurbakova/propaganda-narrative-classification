      "evidence_quote": "Climate groups regularly criticise banks for continuing to invest in the expansion of fossil fuel production when consumption will need to fall if global warming is to be kept to a relatively safe 1.5 degrees Celsius.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence explicitly states that climate groups criticize banks (a financial institution), which is a form of criticism of institutions, but does not match any of the more specific subnarratives (EU, international entities, national governments, political organizations). Therefore, this evidence supports the parent narrative via the 'Other' subnarrative."

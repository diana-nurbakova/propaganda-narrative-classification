They could be the richest country in all of Europe,\" Graham said. \"If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West,\" he added.",

      "evidence_quote": "They’re sitting on 10 to $12 trillion of critical minerals in Ukraine. They could be the richest country in all of Europe.",
      "reasoning": "The focus on Ukraine's mineral wealth highlights Western motives and self-interest in Ukraine, a strand that supports the parent narrative but is not captured by the other specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "Graham is treating Ukraine as a future colony of the US with his comments on the ownership of the country's natural resources.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Ukraine as a resource to be controlled by the West, implying that Western interests (mineral ownership) take precedence over Ukrainian welfare, i.e., a puppet-like dynamic."

      "reasoning": "This passage accuses Western actors of predatory resource extraction and enabling a corrupt neo-Nazi regime in Ukraine, thereby discrediting Western diplomacy and motives."

      "evidence_quote": "\"If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West,\" he added.",
      "reasoning": "This quote presents Western involvement in Ukraine as mutually beneficial and frames the West in a positive, advantageous role, which aligns with the parent narrative URW: Overpraising the West. The specific 'Other' subnarrative is used because the line emphasizes praise of the West's potential role rather than explicit claims like NATO destroying Russia or moral superiority."

      "evidence_quote": "White Garcetti was away, Los Angeles continued to struggle with the high crime and homelessness that have come to define his legacy",

      "evidence_quote": "According to the ICAO Carbon Emissions Calculator, Garcetti’s trip would have burned 1275.6 kg of carbon if he flew economy class, and twice as much if he flew business or “premium” class (assuming a stop in Atlanta). That is one-fourth (economy) or one-half (premium) the global average per capita use of carbon per year.",
      "reasoning": "The text invokes an external carbon-emission calculator to quantify the travel's impact, introducing data-driven measurement that can seed critical scrutiny of the science and its interpretation."

That is one-fourth (economy) or one-half (premium) the global average per capita use of carbon per year. It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses a carbon-emissions calculation and questions the rationale for in-person attendance, illustrating a critical stance toward the measurements and justification used in climate action discourse and placing the text within the 'Other' category when a more specific subnarrative does not neatly apply."

That is one-fourth (economy) or one-half (premium) the global average per capita use of carbon per year. It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "The text cites a carbon-emissions methodology and immediately questions the necessity of in-person attendance, signaling skepticism toward the measurement/methodology and its usage in evaluating the trip."

      "reasoning": "The article characterizes the policies as tyrannical and coercive, framing climate policy as harmful to the public and thus criticizing the policies themselves."

      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "This sentence explicitly frames climate policies as tyrannical and depicts elite support for them, which constitutes a critical stance toward climate policies that does not fit into the more specific subnarratives. Therefore it belongs to the 'Other' category."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",

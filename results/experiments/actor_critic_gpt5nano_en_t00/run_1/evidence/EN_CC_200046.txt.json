It’s a spiral of death and destruction, coming from a death cult pretending to be the planet’s savior.",
      "reasoning": "This excerpt explicitly frames carbon sequestration and related climate policy as a political controversy and uses charged language to cast green technologies and policy debates as dangerous, thereby supporting the parent narrative CC: Controversy about green technologies under the 'Other' subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "The article cites NASA conceding data limitations and proxies, directly challenging the reliability and completeness of climate measurements and the scientific basis of the alarmist claims."

      "evidence_quote": "\"there are too few data before 1880 for scientists to estimate average temperatures for the entire planet,\" NASA has concluded.",
      "reasoning": "The text cites NASA's claim about insufficient data before 1880 and references proxy data (tree rings, ice cores) as being different from instrumental records, illustrating concerns about the reliability of the methodologies used to claim record temperatures."

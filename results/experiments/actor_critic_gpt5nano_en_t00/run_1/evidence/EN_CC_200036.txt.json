      "evidence_quote": "I have been hearing about these end of the world scenarios since I was a kid. And not one of their predictions has come true.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly rejects climate catastrophe predictions, implying that warnings about climate change are exaggerated or unfounded. It does not neatly map to a specific, named subnarrative in the list, so it is best categorized under the general 'Other' catch-all for downplaying arguments."

      "evidence_quote": "That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers, and the rain bombs, and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level, and causing these waves of climate refugees, predicted to reach one billion in this century.",
      "reasoning": "The quote describes a cascade of catastrophic climate effects (ocean boiling, droughts, rising seas, mass climate refugees) framed as imminent, fitting the doomsday subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "The quote uses fear-laden framing—climate crisis, planetary crisis, mass extinction—to amplify concerns about global warming and its consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "Cheap and abundant oil and natural gas have to go, Gore says – for poor people, anyway – in order for the planet to stop warming.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the removal of cheap fossil fuels as a policy-driven goal to 'stop warming,' implying that climate policies would necessitate (and thus cause) higher energy costs or economic hardship for ordinary people, which supports the claim that climate policies have negative economic impact."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants. The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine, and, first and foremost, Ukraine's membership in NATO.",
      "reasoning": "The passage extols the 'free world' and NATO, framing Western unity and support as central to victory, which fits the pattern of Overpraising the West."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "Restructuring Ukraine’s external debt is part of the financial toolkit needed to prevail in this war.",
      "reasoning": "This asserts that debt restructuring is a required measure to prevail in the war, linking policy to an anticipated outcome."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence employs fear-inducing imagery of missiles targeting hospitals to justify actions taken and to intensify concern about the war."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This statement casts Western-aligned forces as the moral agent behind victory, signaling support for the Western-led coalition. However, it does not explicitly claim moral superiority in the form required by the specific 'right side of history' label, so it fits under the broader 'Other' category within the URW narrative. "

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine must prevail in this war!",
      "reasoning": "The quote expresses a normative outcome—victory for Ukraine—without making a concrete forecast about Russian or Ukrainian military outcomes or specific territorial changes, fitting the parent narrative without aligning to the specific subnarratives about armies collapsing or losing territories."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This sentence explicitly frames missiles targeting civilian hospitals as a risk in the war, creating fear about civilian harm. It fits the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears but does not match the more specific subcategories (WWIII, nuclear use, or direct NATO intervention), so it is best captured under 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "'the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more \"greenhouse gases\" like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.'",
      "reasoning": "Claims that natural sources (volcanoes) emit more greenhouse gases than human activity cast doubt on the severity or primacy of human-caused climate change."

      "reasoning": "Directly attacks the motives/credibility of climate protest groups, portraying them as deluded."

      "evidence_quote": "Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "The quote depicts catastrophic, doomsday-scale consequences of climate-related disruption, illustrating an amplified fear of mass death and societal collapse consistent with the Doomsday subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "The text argues that human activity is not the primary driver of climate change by contrasting human emissions with larger natural sources (volcanoes) and other natural contributors."

      "reasoning": "The claim directly challenges CO2 as the primary driver of climate change by arguing that volcanic emissions exceed human-related CO2, undermining the science behind anthropogenic warming."

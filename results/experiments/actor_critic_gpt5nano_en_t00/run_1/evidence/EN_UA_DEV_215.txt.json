    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "The quote predicts or describes adverse effects for Western publics and policymakers resulting from corruption disclosures."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The text questions the reliability of media by citing accusations of propaganda and thin sourcing."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this.",
      "reasoning": "It hypothesizes a future consequence of corruption disclosures on public support for Ukraine."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian nation and society",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded.",

      "reasoning": "A general description of wartime corruption and profiteering that, while not Ukraine-specific, supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine through broader corruption framing."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly discusses a negative consequence for the West (reduced willingness to defend Ukraine) due to revelations of corruption and war profiteering, which aligns with the parent narrative but does not neatly fit the two specific subnarratives provided."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly links military aid to broader security threats and potential Russian aggression, thereby amplifying fear and concern about the war's consequences rather than focusing on a specific outcome."

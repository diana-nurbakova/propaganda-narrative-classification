They could be the richest country in all of Europe,\" Graham said. \"If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West,\" he added.",
      "reasoning": "The statements speculate about future economic/political outcomes of the conflict and Western involvement, projecting Ukraine's mineral wealth as a future boon if aid is provided."

      "reasoning": "The quote frames the conflict in terms of future geopolitical and economic outcomes tied to Ukraine's mineral wealth, implying consequences of war outcomes without asserting specific military strength or territorial results; thus it supports the parent URW: Speculating war outcomes while not fitting the specified army-collapse subnarratives."

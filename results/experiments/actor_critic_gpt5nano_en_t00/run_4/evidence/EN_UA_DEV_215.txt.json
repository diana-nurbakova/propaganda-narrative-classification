      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence attributes corruption to Ukraine itself and describes it as longstanding, directly discrediting Ukraine within the context of the war."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The text foregrounds accusations of propaganda against a prominent media figure, signaling distrust toward media narratives about the war."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames potential negative consequences for Western support, predicting a weakening of public commitment in the West."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian nation and society",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence attributes enduring corruption to Ukrainian society and its institutions, thereby discrediting the Ukrainian nation and society as a whole and implying systemic misuse of foreign aid."

      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "References media figure Hersh and claims about propaganda, signaling a trust-distrust dynamic toward media reporting on Ukraine."

      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The quote portrays a Western media figure as propagandist, signaling distrust toward media broadly. Since it does not neatly fit the 'Western media is an instrument of propaganda' or 'Ukrainian media cannot be trusted' subcategories, it is categorized as 'Other' under Distrust towards Media."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks. The American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this.",
      "reasoning": "These sentences directly describe negative consequences for the West (reduced willingness to fund support for Ukraine and potential shift in public opinion), which aligns with the parent narrative URW: Negative Consequences for the West, categorized here as 'Other' since they do not fit the two more specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "BLINDED by MONEY: Wind farms are KILLING eagles and whales, but the green cult ignores reality as it pockets millions in donations.",
      "reasoning": "The passage attacks the climate movement as a 'green cult' and accuses it of ignoring evidence and financial agendas."

      "evidence_quote": "To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted,\" wrote Ring for American Greatness, while at the same time pointing out that the development of renewable energy sources like hydroelectric and nuclear power plants is also being slowed down, if not completely stopped.",
      "reasoning": "The quoted passage directly frames policy actions as a response to a climate crisis, leveraging fear of global warming to justify halting fossil fuels and delaying renewables, i.e., amplifying fears about climate change."

      "reasoning": "The quote alleges money/donor influence in climate-related policy, a tactic often used to undermine climate narratives; it is not a direct fear of warming but is a strategic claim tied to the climate policy debate."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Alarmists Warn of U.S. ‘Heat Dome’ Tied to Human-Induced Climate Change",
      "reasoning": "The headline uses the term \"Alarmists\" to label climate advocates as alarmist, signaling a critical stance toward the climate movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "Extreme heat events are also increasing in their intensity and duration, bringing along greater fire danger too,",
      "reasoning": "The line emphasizes rising heat events and increased danger, contributing to fear about climate impacts."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "The group’s assertion that in the U.S. most weather-related deaths “are caused by heat” does not stand up to scrutiny",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly doubts the claim’s validity, indicating skepticism about the measurements/data."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "the vast majority of these were cold-related rather than heat-related",
      "reasoning": "The article shows most deaths are cold-related, which minimizes the perceived impact of heat-related climate effects."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming",
      "evidence_quote": "Science Alert warned Monday “worsening human-induced climate change” is contributing to an increase in heat-related deaths as the United States languishes under a “heat dome.”",
      "reasoning": "The sentence explicitly links worsening human-made climate change to more heat-related deaths and mentions a heat dome, reinforcing the portrayal of climate change as causing extreme, dangerous conditions and fueling fear."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Methodologies/metrics used are unreliable/faulty",
      "evidence_quote": "The group’s assertion that in the U.S. most weather-related deaths “are caused by heat” does not stand up to scrutiny, however, since the majority of weather-related deaths come from cold, not heat.",
      "reasoning": "This sentence explicitly questions the reliability/validity of the claim about heat-dominated weather deaths, implying the metrics or interpretation are flawed."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The imbalance between heat-based deaths and cold-based deaths becomes even more apparent when looking at the global scenario, where cold-related deaths dwarf heat-related deaths by nearly ten to one.",
      "reasoning": "Provides data that challenges the idea that heat is the primary driver of weather-related deaths, supporting the parent narrative through data-based doubt, not fitting the specific category above."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Temperature increase does not have significant impact",
      "evidence_quote": "According to the Lancet, people around the world are 9.4 times more likely to die from the cold than from the heat.",
      "reasoning": "The Lancet data showing far higher cold-related mortality compared to heat-related mortality implies that global temperature increases may not translate into large mortality impacts, aligning with a downplaying of the immediacy or magnitude of climate-change-related heat effects."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This sentence extols the unity and moral superiority of Western-aligned forces, fitting the 'Overpraising the West' narrative."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion.",
      "reasoning": "The statement predicts a likely victory outcome for Ukraine, signaling speculation about war results."
    },

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The line invokes catastrophic war scenarios (missile strikes on hospitals), aiming to evoke fear and anxiety about war consequences."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine should join NATO and the European Union.",
      "reasoning": "This is a direct call for Ukraine to align with Western institutions, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting the three more specific subnarratives (e.g., NATO destroying Russia, West on the right side of history, or explicit strongest international support)."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence asserts a predicted outcome (Ukraine is more likely to prevail), which is a direct statement about the war's outcome. It does not specify the collapse of the Russian army or loss of all occupied territories, so it fits the generic 'Other' subnarrative under Speculating war outcomes."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The line explicitly mentions missiles destroying hospitals, a concrete, fear-evoking war harm scenario. It does not reference WWIII, nuclear weapons, or NATO intervention, so it fits the parent narrative as an explicit but narrowly scoped fear without aligning to a more specific subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate change as a threat that restricts basic clothing rights, amplifying fear about the consequences of climate-related policy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This passage portrays environmental/environmental policy as aimed at stripping rights, reflecting skepticism toward climate/climate-related policy motives."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "In his brief opening statement, the unelected globalist founder of the WEF said that the participants must “foster collaboration” in order to drive economic growth and create a more resilient future.",

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes. Citing a new study, Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) is urging governments to clamp down on people who wash their jeans and pants more than once per month, and their sweaters more than once per fortnight.",
      "reasoning": "The excerpt explicitly links climate threat to restrictions on everyday clothing-washing behavior and calls for government action, which illustrates the parent CC: Amplifying Climate Fears by portraying climate concerns as justifying controls on ordinary life."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames environmental/climate policy as aimed at stripping away citizens' fundamental rights, which is a direct criticism of climate policies and fits the 'Other' subnarrative under CC."

      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes, including underwear and gym clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly attributes guidelines to an international organization (the WEF) and frames it as directing public behavior, which fits the criterion of criticizing international entities."

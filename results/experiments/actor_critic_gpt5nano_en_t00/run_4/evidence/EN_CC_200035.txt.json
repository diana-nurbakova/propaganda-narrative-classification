      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "These sentences highlight controversy surrounding green technology initiatives (foreign involvement with CCP-linked entities and local backlash over subsidies) and do not map to the more specific subnarratives (danger, unreliability, cost, nuclear). Therefore, they support the parent narrative under the 'Other' category."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin's suggestion of a ceasefire in Ukraine to freeze the war was rejected by the United States after contacts between intermediaries, Reuters reported exclusively earlier this month.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence directly frames Western diplomatic efforts as ineffective by noting that the United States rejected Putin's ceasefire proposal, illustrating a narrative that discredits Western diplomacy."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly contemplates future battlefield movements and the potential capture of Kyiv, aligning with a narrative that speculates about the war's outcomes."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "assailing the West and warning of the risk of a nuclear apocalypse.",
      "reasoning": "This explicitly shows discrediting the West, which falls under the parent narrative but does not neatly fit the more specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "a counteroffensive which showed serious problems in Russia's military.",
      "reasoning": "The counteroffensive described as having 'shown serious problems in Russia's military' signals significant decline in Russia's military effectiveness, supporting the subnarrative that the Russian army is collapsing."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "On the eve of its second anniversary, Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's, and a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "The line 'Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's' indicates severe weaknesses for the Ukrainian army, which aligns with the notion of the Ukrainian military collapsing under pressure."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.",
      "reasoning": "This sentence forecasts future Armenian-style expansion and targets, which is a speculative claim about outcomes without describing collapse or defeat, fitting the 'Other' subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The claim frames wind energy policy as causing massive tree loss, illustrating negative outcomes and questioning the policy's effectiveness."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,\" adding that the government \"must be alive\" to the \"significant costs\" of the installation.",
      "reasoning": "Directly criticizes the government and its handling, implying incompetence or lack of transparency."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity. The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "Raises concerns about wind energy technology and its environmental and social impacts, reflecting a controversy over green technologies."

Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko [former deputy minister at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs], Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko. Extradition of various oligarchs, like [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky.\"",

      "reasoning": "The quoted passage explicitly discusses Ukraine’s demilitarization and post‑war punitive measures, framing Ukraine’s military power as something to be dismantled and its leadership punished, thereby discrediting the Ukrainian military and state."

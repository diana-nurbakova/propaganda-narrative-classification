      "evidence_quote": "“It’s obvious to the world and it should be obvious to Putin that these objectives are no longer achievable by continuing this war,” Milley believes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly frames continuing the war as unable to achieve its objectives, signaling a perceived collapse of Russian military effectiveness. This is reinforced by the surrounding language describing undertrained, demoralized, and poorly led Russian forces, supporting the subnarrative that the Russian army is collapsing."

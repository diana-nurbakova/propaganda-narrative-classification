      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s “Green New Deal” calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "The quote references a climate policy (Green New Deal) and notes opposition, illustrating critical framing of climate policy within the text."

      "reasoning": "The sentence directly critiques city institutions and authorities (the City Council) and links them to racist comments, fitting the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "“When it comes to fighting the climate crisis, our commitments as cities, states, and countries are only as strong as the size and ambition of our global coalition,” said Mayor Eric Garcetti. “The C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action – it’s a chance to elevate the solutions cities are deploying at a neighborhood level that have a real impact on people’s daily lives. It’s also an opportunity to help national governments better understand the steps we can take together to chart a path toward a more livable and prosperous future.”",
      "reasoning": "The language emphasizes the severity of the climate crisis and the supposedly decisive decade, using strong fear-laden rhetoric ('make-or-break decade'), which aligns with amplifying fears about climate change."

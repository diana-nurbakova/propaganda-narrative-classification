      "reasoning": "The line attributes responsibility for prolonging the conflict to external actors (U.S., Europe), fitting the narrative of blaming others rather than Russia."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "Describes Ukraine's governance as failing, using extreme measures as proof, discrediting Ukraine as an effective actor."
    },

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "the UK and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "Blames Western governments for influencing Ukraine to abandon a negotiated settlement, undermining Western diplomacy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",

    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "So, accepting Russia’s offer to move this conflict from the battlefield to the negotiation table is almost certainly the best chance Ukraine will get to hold onto the eastern territory they still control.",
      "reasoning": "Makes a forecast about the likely outcome of pursuing negotiations, a conjecture about future results."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "Uses fear-inducing language to exhort avoidance of further conflict and suggests catastrophic consequences of misuse of force."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This sentence attributes the escalation to Ukraine's Western backers (the United States and Europe) rather than to the invader, framing the West as the aggressors and responsible for prolonging the war."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence directly states Ukraine lacks sufficient soldiers to penetrate fortified lines, undermining the perceived effectiveness of the Ukrainian military."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "The claim attributes poor or reckless policy decisions to the Ukrainian government, undermining its legitimacy and portraying its leadership as unnecessarily escalatory."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This quote depicts escalations as causing ongoing suffering and elevating global risk (nuclear catastrophe), which aligns with the parent URW narrative by illustrating negative consequences of prolonging the conflict. It does not clearly map to the more specific sanctions or refugee subnarratives, hence it fits under 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence describes dwindling Ukrainian forces and an inability to sustain defense, implying a decline in the army's effectiveness, which aligns with collapsing."

      "evidence_quote": "So, accepting Russia’s offer to move this conflict from the battlefield to the negotiation table is almost certainly the best chance Ukraine will get to hold onto the eastern territory they still control.",
      "reasoning": "This sentence discusses a strategic outcome (holding territory) via negotiation, which supports the parent narrative about war outcomes but does not fit the more specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence describes NATO-related authorization for strikes inside Russia, signaling direct NATO involvement/intervention and aligning with the subnarrative that NATO should/will directly intervene."

      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This line frames ongoing escalations as causing broader harm and increasing risk of a nuclear catastrophe, supporting the parent narrative as an additional/remnant argument (not fitting the specific subnarratives)."

      "evidence_quote": "\"admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly 'green energy' wind turbines.\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote shows policy decisions framed as environmentally harmful to pursue wind energy, signaling criticism of climate policy motivations and effectiveness."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,\" adding that the government \"must be alive\" to the \"significant costs\" of the installation.",
      "reasoning": "The quote attributes concerns and critiques to the government and official bodies, illustrating distrust in institutions handling climate-related development."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "\"wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.\"",
      "reasoning": "Directly presents a criticism of wind energy technology, highlighting environmental and resource concerns associated with green technologies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "\"The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.\"",
      "reasoning": "Describes severe health and safety impacts linked to mineral mining for wind technology, contributing to fear about climate-related tech and its unintended consequences."

      "reasoning": "This evidence highlights environmental and human health risks linked to the extractive supply chain of wind-energy materials, illustrating criticisms of climate policies beyond direct economic concerns."

      "evidence_quote": "Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames wind-energy policy as environmentally harmful by highlighting mass deforestation linked to wind-farm development, which supports the parent narrative of amplifying climate fears. Since a more specific subnarrative does not fit the provided categories, this evidence is categorized under 'Other' within the Amplifying Climate Fears parent."

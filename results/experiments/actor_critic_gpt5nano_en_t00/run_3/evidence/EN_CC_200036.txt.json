      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policy as a driver of international political action, specifically border policy and sovereignty, suggesting green policies function as geopolitical instruments rather than purely environmental measures. This aligns with the parent narrative while not neatly fitting the two more specific subnarratives, hence the 'Other' category."

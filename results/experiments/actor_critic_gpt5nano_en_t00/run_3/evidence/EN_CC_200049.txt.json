      "reasoning": "By presenting data that cold-related deaths are more common, the piece reframes the issue to downplay the perceived threat from heat."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly critiques the measurement claim about heat-caused weather deaths, signaling scrutiny of the underlying methodologies/metrics; the surrounding data (e.g., EPA figures showing more cold deaths) further supports a critique of how the measurements are presented."

      "evidence_quote": "The imbalance between heat-based deaths and cold-based deaths becomes even more apparent when looking at the global scenario, where cold-related deaths dwarf heat-related deaths by nearly ten to one.",
      "reasoning": "The global data show cold-related deaths dominate over heat-related deaths, which can be framed as evidence that warming is not driving large, heat-dominated impacts and may be consistent with a cooling‑leaning interpretation."

      "evidence_quote": "The death rate from heat has slightly increased due to global warming (+0.21 percent), but that the death rate from the cold decreased by more than twice as much (-0.51 percent) during the same period.",
      "reasoning": "Heat-related deaths rise only modestly with warming while cold-related deaths decline more substantially, suggesting that temperature increases do not produce large or sustained impacts compared to cold-related mortality."

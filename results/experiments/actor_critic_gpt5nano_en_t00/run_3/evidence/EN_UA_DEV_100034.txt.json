      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "The quote extols Western unity and moral superiority, portraying the West as the decisive force behind Ukraine's success, which matches the 'Overpraising the West' narrative."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "It enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence frames a future outcome (Ukraine prevailing) as a likely result of actions, aligning with 'Speculating war outcomes'."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "This reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "Uses vivid, fear-inducing imagery of missile attacks on European cities to emphasize stakes and mobilize support."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence extols the 'free world' as victorious over dictatorship, aligning Western actors with moral superiority (a core aspect of overpraising the West)."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine",
      "reasoning": "This phrase emphasizes broad Western unity and long-term backing, contributing to the portrayal of strong Western support."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine must prevail in this war!",
      "reasoning": "The text asserts that Ukraine must prevail in the war, a claim about the outcome of the conflict that does not specify the collapse of Russian forces or territorial losses, thus it fits the generic 'Other' subnarrative under URW: Speculating war outcomes."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence frames debt restructuring as a means to limit civilian casualties from Russian missiles, which is a war-related fear-inducing claim. It does not explicitly fit the four specific subnarratives provided, so it is categorized under 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "This phrasing frames climate policy as something to resist and describes it as 'madness', indicating a critical stance toward climate-related policies."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "THE GREAT CLIMATE CON",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'THE GREAT CLIMATE CON' directly frames climate action as a deceptive scheme, which aligns with a broad 'Other' critique of climate policies rather than a specific defined claim (ineffectiveness, negative economic impact, or profit). The text also includes 'the climate change madness in the UK' as additional anti-climate-movement framing, serving as a reinforcing remainder to the parent narrative."

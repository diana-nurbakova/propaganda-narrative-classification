      "reasoning": "The sentence explicitly states that climate groups criticize banks, which are a financial institution, fitting the parent narrative of criticism of institutions and authorities. However, it does not map to any of the more specific subnarratives (EU, international entities, national governments, political organizations and figures), so it is categorized under 'Other'."

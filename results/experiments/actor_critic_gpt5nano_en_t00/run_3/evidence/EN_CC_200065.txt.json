      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "there are too few data before 1880 for scientists to estimate average temperatures for the entire planet,\" NASA has concluded. Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, \"scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,\" NASA revealed. \"But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?\"",
      "reasoning": "The text cites data limitations and differences between proxy records and instrumental measurements, and ends with a rhetorical jab at science, directly illustrating distrust or doubt about measurements and scientific methods."

      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely 'the hottest day in thousands of years.'",
      "reasoning": "The passage emphasizes sensational, fear-inducing claims about unprecedented warming, aligning with a pattern that amplifies fears about climate change."

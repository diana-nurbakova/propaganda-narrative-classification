It’s a spiral of death and destruction, coming from a death cult pretending to be the planet’s savior.",
      "reasoning": "The quoted statements explicitly criticize climate-change policy and portray climate rhetoric as alarmist, framing climate change as a threat used by political actors and portraying CO2 removal as misguided. This supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives provided; thus it is categorized as 'Other' to capture leftover evidence."

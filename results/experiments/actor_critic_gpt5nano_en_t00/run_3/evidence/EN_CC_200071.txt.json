      "evidence_quote": "\"To allegedly save us all from a 'climate crisis,' development and use of oil, natural gas and coal is being halted,\" wrote Ring for American Greatness, while at the same time pointing out that the development of renewable energy sources like hydroelectric and nuclear power plants is also being slowed down, if not completely stopped.",
      "reasoning": "The quote portrays climate policies as being halted or rolled back, indicating a critical view of the policies and their effects."

      "evidence_quote": "these are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "The claim attacks renewable technologies as economically and environmentally problematic and insufficient to meet energy needs, signaling skepticism toward green technologies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that \"lower greenhouse gas emissions\" and fight the so-called \"climate crisis.\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly references a government program and frames it as an action by authorities, illustrating credible criticism of institutions and their policies."

      "reasoning": "The quote asserts that the energy output of proposed or current climate policies is insufficient to meet national/world energy needs, implying ineffectiveness."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Green energy\" mining is polluting rivers and farmland at an unsustainable pace, leaving 23 million people exposed to toxic waste.",
      "reasoning": "This statement describes environmental harm connected to green energy practices, a claim not neatly captured by the other subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly characterizes wind, solar and biomass as 'inefficient and expensive,' signaling that renewable energy is costly and thus supports the subnarrative."

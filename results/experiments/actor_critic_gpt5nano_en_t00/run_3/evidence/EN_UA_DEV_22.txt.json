      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames a hypothetical alternative outcome of the war depending on West's actions, clearly constituting speculation about how the war might have ended differently."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The speaker attributes responsibility for prolonging the conflict to Western actors (the US and allied actions) rather than Russia, shifting blame away from the invader."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "We must start peace negotiations, but without Americans, and stop these killings.",
      "reasoning": "This criticizes Western diplomacy and explicitly excludes the US from peace efforts, undermining Western-led mediation."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground.",
      "reasoning": "A threat of violent consequences aimed at Western Europe portrays potential harm to Western interests, signaling negative outcomes for the West."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a 'US problem'.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly forecasts a negative outcome for the EU in the conflict with Russia, which is a speculative assessment of war outcomes. It does not fit the specific subnarratives about either army collapsing or losing territories, so it qualifies as the generic 'Other' category under the parent URW: Speculating war outcomes."

      "evidence_quote": "We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes the war to Western actions (the American proxy war) and frames the conflict as being driven by Western interests, thereby blaming the West rather than the invader."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Members of the European Parliament (EP) engaged in mutual insults during debates on the need for further support to Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The mutual insults among EU lawmakers during debates about Ukraine support illustrate internal divisions within the EU on this policy."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia",
      "reasoning": "A claim that the West (EU) has no chance of winning against Russia frames the West as lacking power."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine",
      "reasoning": "This accuses Western actors of pursuing their own interests at Ukraine's expense, rather than Ukraine's welfare."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that Western involvement in supporting Ukraine is costly and counterproductive to Western interests, illustrating negative consequences for the West not captured by the more specific sanctions or refugee subnarratives."

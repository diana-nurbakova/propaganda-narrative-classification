      "reasoning": "The quote asserts that the climate policy rationale is a smokescreen used by the ECB to pursue a different objective (CBDC), which constitutes a critical stance toward climate policies and their motives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "crypto-assets deemed to have an excessive ecological footprint should be banned.",
      "reasoning": "The explicit call to ban crypto-assets due to their excessive ecological footprint signals a controversy about green technologies and their environmental impact. The surrounding text frames this as a regulatory stance, and later notes the motive may be broader (CBDC and limiting non-government-controlled assets), indicating contested green-tech policy."

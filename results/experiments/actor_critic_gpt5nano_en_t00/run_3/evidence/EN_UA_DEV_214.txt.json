      "reasoning": "This line directly expresses distrust in Western media (specifically mainstream newsrooms) and frames it as part of an information war, supporting the parent narrative of distrust towards media. It does not explicitly claim Western media is a propaganda instrument, so it fits 'Other' rather than the more specific 'Western media is an instrument of propaganda' subnarrative."

It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines. America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "The passage explicitly discusses prolonging the conflict (war of attrition), expanding it to Asia, and describing the potential onset of a broader world war. This aligns with the parent narrative of speculating about war outcomes, and does not provide a specific army-collapse claim, hence it fits the 'Other' subnarrative."

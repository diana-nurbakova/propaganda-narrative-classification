      "evidence_quote": "The WSWS noted of Zaluzhny, “Above all, he has established a close relationship with the country’s far-right. He has publicly expressed admiration for the Ukrainian fascist leader Stepan Bandera and has been photographed repeatedly with far-right paraphernalia.”",

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly accuses mainstream media of conspiring to silence important warnings, signaling distrust toward media in general. It does not match the exact wording of the two specific subnarratives (Western media is an instrument of propaganda or Ukrainian media cannot be trusted), so it fits the generic 'Other' category."

      "reasoning": "The sentence explicitly accuses Western powers (Britain) of imperialist aggression and involvement in NATO-led war, which supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West. It does not map to the other precise subnarratives, so it is categorized as 'Other' within URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy."

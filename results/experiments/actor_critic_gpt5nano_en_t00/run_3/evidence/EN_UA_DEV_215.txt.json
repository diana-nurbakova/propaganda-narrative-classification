      "reasoning": "This sentence casts doubt on the credibility of Western media by citing an accusation that a prominent journalist disseminates propaganda, and discusses 'thinly sourced claims' about the war, indicating skepticism toward media narratives."

      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO.",
      "reasoning": "This sentence asserts that Western aid to Ukraine is driven by strategic interests (European/NATO security) rather than concern for Ukraine itself, fitting the subnarrative that the West cares about its own interests, not Ukraine."

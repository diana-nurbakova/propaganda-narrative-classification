      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This targets Kyiv's policies and actions, portraying the government as sacrificing Ukrainian lives and using citizens as cannon fodder, thereby discrediting Ukrainian officials and policy decisions."

      "reasoning": "The line frames the Ukraine conflict as a proxy war and attributes responsibility for its conduct to China, illustrating a framing of the war's dynamics rather than a specific military outcome; thus it supports the URW parent narrative via an 'Other' subcategory."

      "reasoning": "This sentence explicitly states a negative outcome for the West (losing its information war), which supports the parent URW narrative. It does not map neatly to the two more specific subnarratives (sanctions backfire or refugee flows), so it is categorized under 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This line explicitly frames Western media and its messaging as part of an information war and questions the credibility of Western media, signaling distrust toward media. It does not clearly state that Western media is an instrument of propaganda, so it fits the 'Other' category rather than a more specific subnarrative."

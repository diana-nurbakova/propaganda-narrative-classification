      "evidence_quote": "the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames climate policy and activism as a political project driven by radical leftism rather than a neutral environmental issue. This supports the parent narrative by portraying 'green technologies' as controversial due to ideological motives. Additional portions of the piece also characterize elements of the climate movement and leaders (e.g., Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion) with language that frames the movement as anti-climate or anti-capitalist, reinforcing a broad 'Other' subnarrative about controversy surrounding green technologies and climate activism."

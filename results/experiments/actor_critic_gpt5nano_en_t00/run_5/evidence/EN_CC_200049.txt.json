      "reasoning": "The text challenges the claimed primacy of heat-related deaths by presenting data that cold deaths are more prevalent, casting doubt on the measurements or interpretation."

      "evidence_quote": "Alarmists Warn of U.S. ‘Heat Dome’ Tied to Human-Induced Climate Change",
      "reasoning": "The headline explicitly frames climate risk in alarmist terms by labeling climate communicators as 'alarmists' and using fear-evoking language about a heat dome tied to human-induced climate change, signaling an intent to alarm readers about warming and its consequences. The surrounding text further amplifies fear by describing worsening heat, heat waves becoming more frequent, and millions at risk."

      "reasoning": "The sentence directly challenges the claim about which factor causes most weather-related deaths and cites data (cold deaths outpacing heat deaths) to undermine the claim, reflecting a critique of the methodologies/metrics behind the measurement."

      "reasoning": "The article critiques the movement's data interpretation by pointing to data showing cold-related deaths are more common, indicating a challenged measurement/interpretation rather than a direct alarmist claim."

      "evidence_quote": "\"officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote attributes responsibility for the continuation/escalation of the war to Western officials rather than Russia, shifting blame away from the invader."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "\"the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict\"",
      "reasoning": "The claim depicts Ukrainian leadership and its backers as responsible for escalating the war, undermining Ukraine's position."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.\"",
      "reasoning": "Criticizes Western leaders and NATO, implying that Western diplomacy is misguided and urging a return to diplomacy rather than escalation."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "\"if Ukraine falls, its people will be subjugated, its neighbors will be in immediate danger, and all of Europe will be threatened by Putin’s aggressive ambitions.\"",
      "reasoning": "This is a prediction about catastrophic consequences if Ukraine loses, a classic example of speculating about war outcomes."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "\"All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.\"",
      "reasoning": "This frames ongoing actions as leading to extreme danger (nuclear catastrophe), eliciting fear and justification for opposing prolongation of war."

      "evidence_quote": "the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This sentence explicitly attributes the escalation to Western backers (Europe and the United States), shifting responsibility for the war's prolongation away from Russia and onto the West, which matches the subnarrative that the West are the aggressors."

      "evidence_quote": "the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly accuses Western backers (Europe and the United States) of escalating the conflict with provocative actions, framing the West as overreacting rather than pursuing measured diplomacy."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "One month after Russia invaded in early 2022, both sides reached an agreement where Russia would pull back to preinvasion boundaries and, in return, Ukraine would agree to not seek NATO membership. The deal could have put an end to the fighting and handed Kyiv control of all the land Russia had just seized.",
      "reasoning": "This excerpt discusses a hypothetical negotiated end to the conflict and the potential outcome—Ukraine gaining control of seized territories—thus it reflects speculation about war outcomes and fits the 'Other' subnarrative under URW: Speculating war outcomes."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly describes NATO-enabled actions and backing for strikes inside Russia, fitting the subnarrative about NATO intervention."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This line foregrounds nuclear risk and catastrophe as a consequence of escalations, aligning with the fear of nuclear weapon use."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia conducted drills simulating the use of strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus and has sent warships and a submarine to the Caribbean.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of Russia expanding military actions beyond Ukraine (to Belarus and the Caribbean) depicts aggression toward other states, supporting the subnarrative about Russia threatening/attacking other countries."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "None of this is necessary.",
      "reasoning": "A general, non-specific indictment of the escalation that supports the parent narrative but does not map neatly to a specific subnarrative."

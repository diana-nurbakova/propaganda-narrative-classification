      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO.",
      "reasoning": "The quote casts Western military support as self-interested and strategic, challenging the benevolence of Western diplomacy toward Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",

      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO.",
      "reasoning": "Directly asserts that Western aid is driven by strategic, not humanitarian, concerns and frames Ukraine as a means to protect Western interests."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "The American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "Explicitly mentions possible fatigue and reduced willingness to support Ukraine due to corruption revelations."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "Indicates internal debate and lack of a unified, decisive stance within Western leadership, signaling perceived weakness."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its neighbor invaded.",
      "reasoning": "States pre-existing corruption in Ukraine, which does not map neatly to a provided precise subnarrative, thus categorized as Other."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly describes negative consequences for the West (eroding public support and willingness to fund aid) as corruption in Ukraine is exposed, fitting the parent URW narrative and the 'Other' subnarrative since it does not map to the two specific subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "The sentence casts doubt on Western media credibility by labeling a prominent Western journalist as propagandist, implying that Western media reporting on Ukraine can be manipulated or unreliable."

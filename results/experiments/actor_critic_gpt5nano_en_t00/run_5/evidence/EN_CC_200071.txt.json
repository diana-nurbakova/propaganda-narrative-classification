These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.",

      "reasoning": "The quoted phrase frames the climate crisis as a motivation for halting traditional energy sources, suggesting the climate movement uses alarmist framing."

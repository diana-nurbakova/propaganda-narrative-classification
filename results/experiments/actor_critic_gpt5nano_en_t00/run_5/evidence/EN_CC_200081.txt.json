      "evidence_quote": "leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly 'green energy' wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The claim directly ties a climate policy (wind energy expansion) to large environmental costs, challenging the policy's effectiveness/intent."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,\" adding that the government \"must be alive\" to the \"significant costs\" of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quotes critique government actions and underscore concerns about the competence and decisions of authorities."

      "evidence_quote": "\"wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.\"",
      "reasoning": "Directly states criticisms of wind technology and its underlying requirements."

      "evidence_quote": "The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "Describes health and safety hazards linked to mining rare earth minerals used in wind energy magnets, illustrating dangers associated with renewable energy."

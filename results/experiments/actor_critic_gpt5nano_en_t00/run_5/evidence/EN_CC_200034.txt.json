      "evidence_quote": "deluded – or perhaps deluded themselves – into believing that they must appease the climate gods by making all sorts of changes to the existing industrial world order",
      "reasoning": "This casts climate movement participants as misled or irrational, questioning their motives and competence."

      "evidence_quote": "the UK electricity grid relies on natural gas as its 'buffer' energy source. Every day, demand varies according to consumer demand, and the other main energy supplier, renewables, are highly variable and can only power the grid when gas is picking up the lion's share of the gap between their output and consumer demand.",
      "reasoning": "This expresses skepticism about renewables and the reliability of green technologies as substitutes for fossil fuels."

      "reasoning": "The text uses concrete projections of energy disruption and household outages to argue that climate policies would harm the economy and everyday life, illustrating a negative economic impact."

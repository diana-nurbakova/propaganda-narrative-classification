      "reasoning": "The text directly labels climate activists as alarmists and frames their claims as something to criticize, which maps to the narrative criticizing the climate movement."

      "evidence_quote": "asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely “the hottest day in thousands of years.”",
      "reasoning": "The passage highlights alarmist claims about unprecedented heat, which fits the pattern of amplifying fear about climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "there are too few data before 1880 for scientists to estimate average temperatures for the entire planet, NASA has concluded.",
      "reasoning": "The text cites NASA's conclusion about data limitations before 1880 and comments on proxy data vs instrumental records, signaling doubt about the scientific basis and measurements behind the claims."

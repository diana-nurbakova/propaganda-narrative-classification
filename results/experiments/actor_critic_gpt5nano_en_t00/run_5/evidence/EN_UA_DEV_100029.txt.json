      "reasoning": "The quote states that the objectives are no longer achievable by continuing the war, signaling an outcome-oriented assessment within the parent narrative, but it does not explicitly claim a specific outcome like army collapse or loss of territories, thus best fits the generic 'Other' subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "The text notes that activist groups criticized Deutsche Bank's climate policy, which is a criticism of an institution within the climate debate. It does not clearly map to a more specific subnarrative (EU, international entities, national governments, or political organizations/figures), so it fits under 'Other'."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "There is a reason we have eminent domain for some purposes, such as building pipelines and streets. Now, we have an abuse of eminent domain, and also an overriding of zoning – the problem is when you use it for something that relies on hype, without a proven and compelling public interest.",

      "reasoning": "The quote attacks federal policy (Inflation Reduction Act) as serving corporate interests, signaling criticism of national government actions in climate policy."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The Democratic lawmakers themselves, along with a lot of Republicans even in red states, are just getting so much money from these companies,",

      "reasoning": "The quote critiques green energy as fraudulent and accuses foreign interests of benefiting from it, fitting the parent narrative but not aligning with any of the four specific subnarratives (danger, unreliability, cost, nuclear climate-friendliness). It thus belongs to the generic 'Other' category."

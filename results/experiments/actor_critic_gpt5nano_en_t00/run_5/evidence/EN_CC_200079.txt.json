    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote asserts climate-change-driven policies restricting personal clothing hygiene, portraying climate policy as oppressive."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "In his brief opening statement, the unelected globalist founder of the WEF said that the participants must \"foster collaboration\" in order to drive economic growth and create a more resilient future.",
      "reasoning": "The text labels the WEF leadership as unelected globalists and presents their call for collaboration as criticism of elites."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "Citing a new study, Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) is urging governments to clamp down on people who wash their jeans and pants more than once per month, and their sweaters more than once per fortnight.",
      "reasoning": "The policy proposal described fosters fear and anxiety about personal daily-life restrictions tied to climate policy."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly asserts that climate-change framing leads to restrictions on a basic personal freedom (washing clothes), illustrating a broader critique of climate policies; it does not neatly fit the more specific subnarratives provided, thus fit for the 'Other' category."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "This sentence attributes policy power to the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international organization, portraying it as directing governments and curbing consumer rights."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "the unelected globalist founder of the WEF",
      "reasoning": "The phrase explicitly insults Klaus Schwab/WEF as an unelected, globalist figure and targets a political organization and its leadership."

      "evidence_quote": "TRENDING: US Gov’t Building Secret Detention Facilities in 50 States for ‘Non-Compliant Dissidents’",
      "reasoning": "Represents anti-government content not directly tied to the specific climate-related subnarratives, thus serving as leftover evidence of the parent narrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence frames climate change as an imminent threat that justifies drastic social controls, which aligns with amplifying existing fears of global warming."

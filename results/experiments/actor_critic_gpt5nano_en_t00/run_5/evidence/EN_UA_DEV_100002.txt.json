They have numerous targets. Indeed they have the entire world as their target. It is unspoken but it is true. So I will speak it. Russia is at war with pure evil. Again there is no sugar coating it. The only way is to destroy NATO itself before it destroys the world. With God this is possible. Without him it is not. We must ask Gods intervention, protection and wisdom. Choose your weapons carefully. God will take care of the rest.",

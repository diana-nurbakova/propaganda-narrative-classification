      "evidence_quote": "Climate groups regularly criticise banks for continuing to invest in the expansion of fossil fuel production when consumption will need to fall if global warming is to be kept to a relatively safe 1.5 degrees Celsius.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence directly characterizes a financial institution (banks) as being criticized, which aligns with the parent narrative of general criticism of institutions and authorities. It does not map to the more specific subnarratives (EU, international entities, national governments, political figures). Therefore, 'Other' is the appropriate subnarrative."

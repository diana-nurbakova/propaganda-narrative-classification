      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "Democrats will continue to deride “climate change” as the greatest threat and continue to guilt the world into paying more to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase casts climate change as the 'greatest threat' and frames policy responses as costly actions, which is a classic amplification of fear about climate risks."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The sequestration of carbon dioxide is a grave mistake that will slowly harm important ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "reasoning": "Directly attacks a climate policy (carbon sequestration), suggesting it will cause harm, thereby criticizing climate policy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Climate change is beneficial",
      "evidence_quote": "CO2-induced greening has further advantages in certain ecosystems, including changes in water dynamics that could influence the future risk of drought and the agricultural productivity of a given area.",
      "reasoning": "Presents CO2-related greening as beneficial and advantageous for ecosystems and productivity, implying positive effects of climate-related changes."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming",
      "evidence_quote": "The sequestration of carbon dioxide is a grave mistake that will slowly harm important ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere. Of course, as wildfires and droughts increase, Democrats will continue to deride “climate change” as the greatest threat and continue to guilt the world into paying more to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It’s a spiral of death and destruction, coming from a death cult pretending to be the planet’s savior.",
      "reasoning": "The passage uses alarmist language ('greatest threat', 'spiral of death and destruction', 'death cult') to portray climate change as an existential peril and to cast political opponents as exploiting fear, thereby amplifying fears about global warming."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "continue to guilt the world into paying more to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase frames climate policy as imposing additional costs on society, suggesting a negative economic impact."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The sequestration of carbon dioxide is a grave mistake that will slowly harm important ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "reasoning": "Directly states that a climate policy action (CO2 sequestration) will cause environmental harm, not fitting the economy-specific subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s a spiral of death and destruction, coming from a death cult pretending to be the planet’s savior.",
      "reasoning": "Uses extreme rhetoric to discredit climate policy supporters; evidences the parent narrative through hyperbolic framing, not captured by the specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Climate change is beneficial: CO2 is beneficial",
      "evidence_quote": "Elevated CO2 levels enhance vegetation growth through the so-called \"fertilization effect\" and improve water use efficiency.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly states that elevated CO2 levels boost vegetation growth and improve water use efficiency, which aligns with the subnarrative that CO2 is beneficial."

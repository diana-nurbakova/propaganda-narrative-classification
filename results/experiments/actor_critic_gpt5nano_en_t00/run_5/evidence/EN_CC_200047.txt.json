      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The phrasing uses fear-inducing framing ('A disturbing new report' and 'tyrannical “climate” policies'), presenting the issue as alarming and amplifying fear about climate policies."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly characterizes climate change as an obsession of the very rich and highly educated, which critiques the motives/credibility of elites and associated institutions."

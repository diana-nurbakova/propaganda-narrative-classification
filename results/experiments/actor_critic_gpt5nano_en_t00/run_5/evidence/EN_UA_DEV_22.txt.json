      "evidence_quote": "\"Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,\" said Irish MEP Clare Daly. \"And you have the audacity to claim that this is assistance to Ukraine. The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies. Don’t expect the citizens of the EU to support you in this; you speak like crazed maniacs.\"",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly attributes responsibility for prolonging the conflict to Western leaders' decision to veto a peace agreement, framing the West’s actions as driving the war and supporting arms interests rather than Ukraine."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "\"We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote depicts violent consequences directed at Western Europe if policy continues, signaling negative outcomes for Western nations."

      "evidence_quote": "We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,” he said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes the war to Western actions (American proxy war) and describes it as fueling a conflict not in EU interests, thus portraying the West as aggressors rather than the invader."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,” he said.",
      "reasoning": "The quote argues that Western actions in supporting Ukraine are counterproductive to Western interests and harmful to the West, aligning with the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West. It does not fit the two specific subnarratives about sanctions or refugee flows."

      "evidence_quote": "Russian troops will go much further into Ukraine, taking the southern city of Odesa and might even one day push on to the capital Kyiv, a senior ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday.",
      "reasoning": "The sentence projects future military actions and territorial expansion (Odesa and potentially Kyiv), which aligns with the parent URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other rather than a direct measure of military strength."

      "reasoning": "Medvedev asserts Odessa belongs to Russia, uses historical/linguistic rationale and asserts it as a Russian city, which constitutes a favorable portrayal of Russia's claims and leadership, aligning with the parent narrative of praise of Russia under a general 'Other' category since it does not fit the more specific subnarratives."

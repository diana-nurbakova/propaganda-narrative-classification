    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism. Run your eye down the contributors to The Climate Book and you can see who she’s been reading: Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Naomi Klein. For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames Greta Thunberg and her associated thinkers as having a hidden, radical political agenda (anti-capitalism) that supersedes genuine environmental concern, directly challenging the motives and integrity of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "The text presents Greta Thunberg's characterization of COP (a major climate policy forum) as a deceptive and ineffective scam, which aligns with questioning the effectiveness and motives behind established climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This concluding statement explicitly frames the climate movement's goals not as environmental protection, but as a tool for geopolitical and ideological warfare aimed at undermining Western civilization."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement suggests the true, hidden purpose of the mainstream climate agenda is a radical political transformation, implying a deceptive scheme by activists and intellectuals."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'human alarm bell' and 'climate Cassandra' directly frames Greta Thunberg and, by extension, the climate movement she represents, as figures defined by alarmism and exaggerated warnings."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto.",
      "reasoning": "The description of Thunberg's manifesto as 'demented' is a direct personal attack on her mental state and credibility, rather than a substantive critique of her arguments."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by alleging its true, hidden goal is not environmental protection but a radical political and cultural revolution. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks' as defined."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly characterizes a major international climate policy framework (COP) as a deceptive scheme for financial or reputational gain ('greenwashing'), aligning with the definition that climate policies are driven by profit rather than genuine environmental goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism... For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism... The only solution to this state of emergency is for rich countries to immediately abandon economic expansion as a social goal.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes climate activism and policy advocacy by framing it as a radical, anti-capitalist political ideology (Thunbergism, de-growth) rather than a legitimate environmental effort. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions about ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive; it instead argues the policies are a cover for a hostile political agenda."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Normal” was the “system” which gave us the climate crisis, a system of “colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide”, of “racist, oppressive extractionism”.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly frames the climate crisis and the system behind it as rooted in colonialism and imperialism, suggesting that green activism is a response to and a critique of these historical and ongoing exploitative practices, aligning with the definition of green activities being a form of neo-colonialism critique."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote characterizes a major international climate forum (COP) as a deceptive and exploitative mechanism, directly criticizing international climate relations as abusive and not genuine, fitting the definition of exploitative international relations."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "This concluding statement frames the entire climate movement as a geopolitical instrument aimed at destroying Western civilization and imposing a hostile ideological system. It supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'exploitative relations' or 'neo-colonialism', as it presents a broader civilizational conflict."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that the stated goal of the climate agenda is a deceptive cover for a different, radical political motive, aligning with the definition of claiming the push for climate action is driven by ulterior motives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "We can’t trust the elites produced by this system to confront its flaws – that’s why she, much like Rishi Sunak, won’t be bothering with the COP meeting this year. COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups by characterizing the COP (Conference of the Parties) and the elites involved as part of a deceptive, untrustworthy scheme, but it does not specifically blame 'global elites' as a secretive cabal nor does it solely claim a hidden political motive; it adds a distinct layer of systemic deceit and institutional corruption."

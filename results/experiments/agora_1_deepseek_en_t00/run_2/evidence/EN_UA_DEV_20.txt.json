      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto Western nations (the UK and US), framing them as the actors who prevented a peaceful settlement."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine. As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "This passage undermines Ukraine's military and governmental effectiveness by highlighting desperate and potentially unpopular conscription measures, portraying the state as struggling and coercive."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Western (and Ukrainian) policy as reckless and counterproductive, directly discrediting their diplomatic and military strategy as pointless and dangerous."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the prolongation of the war on Ukraine and its Western backers for their escalatory actions, rather than on Russia's initial invasion and continued aggression. It is a distinct argument not captured by the specific 'West are the aggressors' subnarrative, which focused on the origin of the conflict, while this focuses on its prolongation."

      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by highlighting the failure of a major military operation and net territorial loss."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement delegitimizes the Ukrainian government's decision-making, portraying its actions (and those of its allies) as reckless and lacking strategic value, which fits the definition of discrediting government policies."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv... But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This portrays Ukraine's military situation as unsustainable and without a viable path to victory, emphasizing a lack of potential positive future, which aligns with the 'situation is hopeless' subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What makes Ukraine’s situation even more tragic is how easily it could have been avoided.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the overarching narrative of discrediting Ukraine by implying its leadership bears responsibility for unnecessary suffering, but it does not cleanly fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about government corruption, military failure, or being a puppet in this specific instance). It is a distinct, leftover argument that reinforces the parent narrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly contrasts Russia's strong military production with the West's comparatively weaker output, presenting the West as non-potent and unable to match Russia's war effort, which aligns with the definition of 'The West is weak'."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims Western officials (UK and US) persuaded Ukraine to reject a peace deal, implying they prioritized continuing the conflict (potentially for their own geopolitical interests) over ending Ukrainian suffering, fitting the subnarrative that the West disregards Ukraine's fate for its own benefits."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the West and Ukraine for choosing escalation over a diplomatic opportunity (negotiations based on current lines), implying that diplomatic solutions are being rejected or are ineffective, which discredits the potential of diplomatic efforts."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "While not a direct claim about Western fatigue, the text's overall emphasis on Ukraine's unsolvable manpower crisis, diminishing leverage, and the futility of continued Western-backed fighting implicitly supports the idea that prolonged support is pointless, aligning with the notion that the West is or should be becoming disinterested in a losing cause."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "This final statement supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western leadership (Biden, NATO) as delusional and irresponsible, advocating for a shift to diplomacy. It criticizes Western strategy but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not solely about division, weakness, overreaction, lack of care, diplomatic failure, or fatigue)."

      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly warns against continuing a military offensive against Russia, framing it as a dangerous fantasy that could lead to a major escalation, implicitly evoking the fear of a world war if diplomacy is not pursued."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear by claiming that current escalatory actions are increasing the risk of a catastrophic nuclear event, directly supporting the subnarrative about the possibility of nuclear weapons being employed."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia. Around the same time, Ukraine struck two Russian strategic nuclear early-warning radars... The escalations have not been one-sided. Russia conducted drills simulating the use of strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus and has sent warships and a submarine to the Caribbean.",
      "reasoning": "This series of quotes describes a cycle of dangerous military escalations involving NATO weapons, strikes on strategic assets, and nuclear signaling. While it contributes to the overall narrative of amplifying war-related fears, the specific combination of actions (strikes on early-warning radars, nuclear drills, naval deployments) does not fit neatly into the other defined subnarratives, as it is a broader pattern of escalation increasing the risk of conflict."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "At the same time, the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers that no amount of foreign aid or equipment transfers can do anything to alleviate... As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly describes a significant decline in the Ukrainian military's manpower and effectiveness, suggesting it is struggling to sustain its fighting force, which aligns with the definition of the Ukrainian army collapsing."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv.",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on a war outcome—that Ukraine cannot achieve its military objectives and will not be able to liberate occupied territories. It supports the parent narrative of speculating on war outcomes but does not perfectly match the provided specific subnarratives (e.g., it implies Ukraine cannot win back territory, but does not explicitly state 'Russian army will lose all occupied territories')."

      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of living (housing, fuel, utilities) to green policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American... who warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Biden's policies as a 'globalist green agenda' with harmful consequences, challenging the competence and intentions of the administration and its institutions."

      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment...",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies (wind, solar, biomass), labeling them as inefficient, expensive, and environmentally destructive."

      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",

      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring. \"And these elevated prices for essentials factor into price increases for everything else.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of housing, fuel, and utilities to climate policies, arguing they negatively impact the economy by making essential goods and services unaffordable."

      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the promoted renewable energy sources are inefficient, environmentally destructive, and incapable of meeting energy demands, suggesting the policies aimed at transitioning to them are ineffective at achieving their goals."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by framing them as a national security weakness, an argument not covered by the specific subnarratives about economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the policies of a specific political figure (President Biden), blaming his 'green policies' for negative economic consequences, which fits the definition of discrediting political figures in the climate change debate."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the actions of a national government agency (the U.S. Department of Energy under the Biden administration) for implementing policies that are portrayed as burdensome and costly, directly disapproving of how the national government is handling climate-related policy."

These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the underlying approach and rationale of climate/energy policy, which is a form of criticism directed at the authorities and institutions promoting these policies. However, it does not specifically target the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures, making it a 'remainder' that supports the parent narrative but fits the 'Other' category."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are incapable of meeting the energy demands of the nation or world, which aligns with the definition of unreliability for widespread adoption."

      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly labels wind, solar, and biomass as 'inefficient and expensive,' directly supporting the subnarrative that renewable energy is too costly and inefficient for widespread use."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Green energy\" mining is polluting rivers and farmland at an unsustainable pace, leaving 23 million people exposed to toxic waste.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the mining required for green energy infrastructure causes significant environmental pollution and exposes millions to toxic waste, framing renewable energy as posing significant risks and dangers."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative (controversy about green technologies) by blaming green policies for broad affordability crises (housing, fuel, utilities), but this specific argument about causing socioeconomic hardship does not fit any of the more specific technical subnarratives provided (danger, unreliability, cost, nuclear)."

      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the domestic economic consequences of green policies (unaffordable housing, energy) as a national security weakness, implying that these policies are a form of geopolitical self-sabotage that leaves the country vulnerable to adversaries, which aligns with the idea of international climate relations being exploitative or abusive to national strength."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Edward Ring... warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' directly frames the policies as instruments of a supranational or international agenda, which supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments. This specific phrasing does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives but clearly advances the core idea that climate policy is a tool for broader geopolitical control or influence."

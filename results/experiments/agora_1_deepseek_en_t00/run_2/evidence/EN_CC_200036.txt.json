      "reasoning": "This quoted statement from Al Gore, presented in the text, lists a catastrophic chain of consequences (boiling oceans, droughts, sea level rise, a billion refugees) which serves as a primary example of amplifying fears about climate change."

It is a general dismissal of climate change predictions."

      "reasoning": "This quote, presented as Gore's alleged claim, suggests that climate policy is being used to pressure sovereign nations (like America) to surrender control of their borders, framing green demands as a form of external control and erosion of national sovereignty, which aligns with the neo-colonialism subnarrative of developed nations imposing conditions on others."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by arguing they are hypocritical and exploitative, targeting the energy access of 'poor people' while elites like Gore are portrayed as exempt. It criticizes the policy as an instrument of control and inequality but does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' (focused on international relations) or 'neo-colonialism' (focused on cross-national control) definitions, representing a distinct, leftover argument."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions Russia's invasion as a cause, but also includes 'the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych' as a contributing factor to Ukraine's financial crisis. This fits the narrative of shifting some blame for negative outcomes (Ukraine's economic distress) away from the sole aggressor (Russia) and onto a Ukrainian actor."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "However, the $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs. At least $400 billion is needed to avoid loss.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the current International Monetary Fund-supported program's assessment as 'misleading' and insufficient, implying that Western-led financial institutions are not adequately understanding or meeting Ukraine's needs, which aligns with discrediting Western diplomatic or financial efforts."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly predicts dire negative consequences for Western cities (Amsterdam, Warsaw, Berlin, Prague) if Ukraine is not adequately supported, framing the conflict as a direct threat to the West's security. This highlights adverse outcomes for Western countries to argue for more support."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This statement evokes fear and anxiety by graphically describing potential Russian missile attacks on civilian infrastructure in major European capitals, suggesting the war could spread and directly threaten the West. This is designed to elicit concern about severe consequences."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the conflict as one where the 'civilized world' (the West) is actively weakening an 'aggressor' through financial warfare, implying the West's actions (sanctions, asset confiscation) are a form of aggression that escalates or sustains the conflict, shifting responsibility from the invader to the Western bloc's response."

      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This statement attributes Ukraine's 2015 financial crisis not solely to the Russian invasion but also to the 'poor policies' of a former Ukrainian president. This shifts partial blame for Ukraine's pre-war and war-related difficulties onto internal Ukrainian leadership, which aligns with the parent narrative of blaming the war on others rather than the invader, but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Some believe that since Ukraine receives large amounts of international aid, it can be used to settle with bondholders. However, over two-thirds of financial assistance arrives as loans to be redeemed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western financial assistance is not a selfless gift but is structured as loans that must be repaid, implying the West's primary interest is in securing its own financial returns rather than purely supporting Ukraine's survival."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The statement implies that the 'civilized world' (the West) has not yet effectively weakened Russia through its financial tools, suggesting a lack of potency or decisive action, which aligns with the narrative of Western weakness."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "According to the current International Monetary Fund-supported program (Q2, 2023 – Q1, 2027), Ukraine’s need for external financial assistance is estimated at $122 billion. However, over two years of the full-scale war, partners have already disbursed $100 billion annually. Therefore, the $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs. At least $400 billion is needed to avoid loss.",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes Western-led financial institutions (IMF) and partners for providing an assessment of Ukraine's needs that is vastly inadequate and 'misleading,' which discredits the West's planning and commitment, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting a more specific subcategory."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that Western sanctions and asset confiscation are necessary to weaken Russia, but the broader context of the article argues that without massive financial support and debt restructuring for Ukraine, the West faces severe negative consequences, suggesting that insufficient action (or the failure of sanctions to be fully effective without accompanying support) will lead to dire outcomes for the West."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly catastrophizes the potential negative consequences for Western nations (specifically European capitals) if Ukraine is not adequately supported, framing the conflict as a direct security threat to the West that will escalate if Ukraine fails."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly warns that if Ukraine does not prevail, the threat of Russian military aggression will extend to other European countries, specifically naming cities in NATO members (Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Czech Republic). This directly matches the definition of evoking fear that Russia will attack other countries."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the effectiveness and environmental impact of a specific climate policy (wind farm development), framing it as contradictory ('green energy' in scare quotes) and harmful due to tree loss."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lists multiple negative consequences (deforestation, wildlife harm, reliance on problematic supply chains) associated with wind turbines, expressing clear skepticism and criticism of this green technology."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "By highlighting dependency on a geopolitical rival ('Communist China') for materials essential to green technology, the text frames the policy as creating or reinforcing geopolitical vulnerabilities, suggesting it serves interests beyond environmental ones."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), Mairi Gougeon, has admitted that some 15.7 million trees were cut down...",
      "reasoning": "The use of politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') and the focus on an admission of a negative action (mass tree felling) challenges the competence and integrity of the governing institution implementing the climate policy."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses 'supposedly' to cast doubt on the environmental benefit of the wind farms, implying the policy (promoting wind energy) is counterproductive by destroying trees, thus failing to achieve genuine environmental goals."

      "evidence_quote": "“I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'damage to... business' as a concern raised by communities affected by wind farm development, directly linking the climate policy to negative economic outcomes."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes climate policies (wind energy) by highlighting severe environmental and human costs (pollution, health issues) associated with the supply chain in China. It supports the parent narrative but does not fit the definitions of 'ineffective', 'bad for economy', or 'only for profit'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that wind turbines cause significant harm, linking them to environmental damage (to wildlife) and severe health consequences for people due to the mining of rare earth minerals, which fits the definition of 'Renewable energy is dangerous'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "However, responding to the letter, Mr Kerr said: “Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,” adding that the government “must be alive” to the “significant costs” of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'significant costs' associated with wind turbine installation, framing the development as having a high price, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive or inefficient."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by framing the green energy push as hypocritical ('supposedly ‘green energy’') and destructive (cutting down trees), creating controversy. The argument about the visual impact, damage to business, and questioning the location of developments also supports the parent narrative but is not captured by the more specific subnarratives defined (dangerous, unreliable, costly, nuclear). Therefore, this remainder evidence necessitates the inclusion of 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly links Western 'green' wind energy projects to exploitative and harmful mining practices in China, framing the pursuit of renewable energy as a form of externalizing environmental and health costs onto a developing nation, which aligns with the definition of neo-colonialism where developed countries exert control and cause harm to others for their own benefit."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the Scottish government's green energy policy as hypocritical and destructive, suggesting that the policy is not genuinely environmental but rather a politically motivated instrument ('green madness') that causes significant local environmental damage. This supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical/instrumental, but the specific argument about domestic hypocrisy and destruction does not fit the 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the actions and policies of the Scottish national government, portraying its 'green energy' push as hypocritical and destructive, which fits the definition of disapproving of how a national government handles climate change."

      "reasoning": "The quote uses pejorative labels ('leftist-separatist') and focuses on a specific political figure (Mairi Gougeon) and party (SNP) to discredit their actions and admissions in the context of climate policy."

      "evidence_quote": "Nevertheless, the Scottish government has vowed to continue its “green energy” push, with a Forestry and Land Scotland spokesman saying: “Renewable energy generated from wind farms is a key element in Scotland’s response to the climate emergency and the shift towards net zero...",
      "reasoning": "This quote, and the article's framing of the government's vow as proceeding 'nevertheless' despite the presented criticisms, supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities. However, the specific criticism here—persisting with a policy despite negative consequences—does not neatly fit the more specific subnarratives of criticizing the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures/organizations in isolation. It is a broader criticism of institutional stubbornness or misguided policy implementation."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly questions the effectiveness and catastrophic consequences of the climate policy advocated by the Just Stop Oil movement, framing it as genocidal."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The theory that climate fanatics have adopted as to why this is all happening blames human activity and industry... member of groups like Just Stop Oil have been deluded – or perhaps deluded themselves – into believing that they must appease the climate gods",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the motives and integrity of the climate movement by labeling its members as 'fanatics' and 'deluded,' and characterizing their beliefs as a quasi-religious appeasement of 'climate gods.'"

      "evidence_quote": "the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This statement minimizes the significance of human-caused climate change by arguing that natural sources like volcanoes emit more greenhouse gases, thereby downplaying the impact of human activity."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "The text cites a claim that there is 'no science' supporting the phase-out of fossil fuels, directly raising doubts about the scientific consensus and data underpinning climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "The text amplifies fears about the consequences of implementing climate policies by predicting a catastrophic, multi-billion death toll and the collapse of civilization."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that implementing the climate policy (stopping oil use) would fail to achieve its intended environmental goal and instead lead to catastrophic human death, framing the policy as fundamentally ineffective and counterproductive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "On the very first day of an oil- and gas-free world... all homes, businesses, and other structures that rely on either or both of these for light, heat, fuel, or what have you would no longer function.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the proposed climate policy would cause immediate and total dysfunction of homes and businesses, which is a direct negative economic and societal impact, collapsing the industrial order."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by challenging the scientific basis for climate policies, arguing that natural sources are the real problem, making human-focused policies misguided. This specific argument does not fit the definitions of 'ineffective', 'negative economic impact', or 'only for profit'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'fear of \"boiling oceans\"' uses exaggerated, alarmist language to characterize the climate movement's concerns, suggesting they are hyperbolic and not based in reality."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "The answer, in part, is propaganda.",

      "evidence_quote": "If we 'just stop oil' like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die... Six billion deaths are about as genocidal as it gets",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes the climate movement by presenting an extreme, catastrophic consequence (mass death) as the direct and inevitable result of its policy demands. It frames the movement's goals as inherently destructive and murderous, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem' subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that natural sources (volcanoes) emit far more greenhouse gases than human activities (cars, cattle), thereby arguing that human activities are not the primary driver of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change by citing an authority figure to claim there is no scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels. This argument does not fit any of the other specific subnarrative definitions, which focus on natural cycles, weather, impact severity, CO2 concentration, human causation, ice melt, sea levels, or adaptation."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the scientific consensus by asserting that natural sources of greenhouse gases dwarf human contributions, implying that human-caused emissions are not the primary driver of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is 'no science' to back the 'green' phase-out of earth-based 'fossil' fuel use.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses the authority of a COP28 president to claim a lack of scientific backing for a major climate policy, thereby discrediting the scientific consensus that supports fossil fuel phase-out."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Do you believe the planet is melting or boiling due to man-made climate change? Learn more about why this is not the case at Climate.news.",
      "reasoning": "This statement dismisses the core claims of anthropogenic climate change ('melting or boiling') and directs readers to a source that argues 'this is not the case,' which supports the parent narrative of questioning climate science but does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "The headline directly presents an intense catastrophic scenario (six billion deaths) as the immediate result of following climate protesters' demands, fitting the definition of a doomsday scenario for humans."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming",
      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'boiling oceans destroying the planet' is a hyperbolic and panic-inducing amplification of the existing scientific concept of ocean warming, used to mock and amplify fears."

      "evidence_quote": "As the end of the biblical age of grace approaches, the world is increasingly coming unhinged, including environmentally as the birth pangs intensify.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames environmental disruption as a sign of an apocalyptic, religiously-themed end times, which supports the parent narrative of amplifying climate fears but does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

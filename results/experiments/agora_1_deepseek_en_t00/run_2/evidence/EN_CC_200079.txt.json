    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policy (in this case, guidelines on washing frequency) as an extreme and unreasonable infringement on personal rights, questioning its motives and effectiveness by presenting it as a removal of a fundamental right to cleanliness."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the World Economic Forum, accusing it of hypocrisy and of designing policies that unfairly target ordinary citizens while protecting the elite."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "The text portrays the WEF's environmental guidelines as part of a deliberate scheme by a powerful globalist elite (led by Klaus Schwab) to oppress ordinary citizens and strip away their rights, which aligns with the narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing “the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.”",
      "reasoning": "The text connects the WEF's climate agenda (exemplified by washing restrictions) with its praise for China and its gathering of global elites, suggesting environmental policies are tools for consolidating geopolitical and economic influence among a select, powerful group rather than being purely about environmental concern."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly contrasts the proposed policy (restricting laundry) with the massive carbon footprint of the elites promoting it, implying the policy is hypocritical and ineffective at addressing the real problem, as it targets minor citizen behavior while ignoring major elite emissions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the climate policy as a direct restriction on consumer purchasing, which would negatively impact the fashion industry and broader consumer economy by limiting sales and consumption."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that climate policies are designed to protect elite privileges and profits (by not targeting their high-emission activities like private jets) while imposing burdens on ordinary citizens, suggesting the policies serve elite financial interests rather than genuine environmental goals."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by framing them as an extreme, absurd, and rights-stripping overreach that attacks fundamental personal hygiene and dignity, which is a distinct argument not covered by the other specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The text directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and 'ordering' governments, portraying it as an overreaching authority imposing unreasonable climate-related policies on the public."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes 'globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians' associated with the WEF, accusing them of hypocrisy by engaging in high-carbon activities while advocating for restrictive policies on ordinary citizens."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities (the WEF) but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives. It accuses the WEF of protecting elite privileges while designing policies to strip rights from ordinary citizens, which is a broader criticism of its motives and actions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Blaming global elites",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes the climate policy of restricting laundry to a secretive, powerful group (the WEF and its associated elites), framing it as a deliberate strategy to protect elite privileges while taking rights from ordinary citizens."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the climate change agenda (promoted by Schwab/WEF) as a pretext for stripping away fundamental personal rights and freedoms, suggesting an ulterior motive of social control rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In his brief opening statement, the unelected globalist founder of the WEF said that the participants must 'foster collaboration' in order to drive economic growth and create a more resilient future.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'unelected globalist founder' and the description of the WEF's collaborative efforts support the parent narrative of secretive, powerful groups orchestrating plans. This evidence is distinct from blaming elites or alleging hidden motives for the climate agenda; it reinforces the overarching theme of unaccountable, coordinated global power."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by implying that green policies and forums like the WEF are instruments for geopolitical alignment and influence, specifically praising China's model, which is a distinct argument not covered by the more specific subnarratives of abuse or neo-colonialism."

      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes NATO, a Western alliance, portraying it as obsolete and transformed into a tool for aggressive expansion, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Western diplomatic and military structures."

      "reasoning": "This statement shifts blame for the war's continuation and nature away from Russia (the invader) and onto China and the West, accusing them of enabling or prolonging the conflict."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's government and military actions by portraying them as callously sacrificing their own citizens, which attacks the legitimacy and morality of Ukraine's war effort."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear by predicting the conflict's expansion into a global or world war, which is designed to elicit anxiety about severe, widespread consequences."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the reliability and truthfulness of Western mainstream media and official narratives, suggesting they are not believed outside their own circles, which aligns with fostering distrust towards media sources."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition, then expand it to Asia. It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly states that the West is willing to prolong the war in Ukraine for its own strategic benefit (expanding to Asia), showing a callous disregard for Ukrainian lives, which are dismissed as expendable 'cannon fodder'."

      "evidence_quote": "So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war. Seriously.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the West's massive military support for Ukraine as excessive and futile ('still not winning'), while simultaneously portraying its accusation against China as absurd and disproportionate, fitting the definition of claiming the West is overreacting."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying NATO not as a legitimate defensive alliance but as an aggressive, expansionist tool. This argument discredits Western diplomatic and security structures but does not fit neatly into any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, lack of care for Ukraine, failed diplomacy, or fatigue)."

So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts the responsibility for the war's continuation and escalation onto the West, framing it as a 'proxy war' they are waging and failing at, while falsely accusing China of being the enabler. It blames the West for the conflict rather than the invading nation."

      "reasoning": "This statement portrays the West as the active agent deliberately prolonging and expanding the war for strategic gain, framing them as the aggressors responsible for escalation, rather than the nation that initiated the invasion."

      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by framing NATO (and by extension the West/US) as the primary force of military expansionism, which is a core argument for shifting blame away from the invader. It does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' subnarratives as neatly as the other quotes, as it focuses on NATO's general role rather than the specific cause of the Ukraine war, but it clearly contributes to the narrative of blaming the West for conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly delegitimizes the Ukrainian government's mobilization policies, portraying them as desperate, inhumane, and treating citizens as expendable, which fits the definition of discrediting the government and its actions."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine?... the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict...",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'proxy war' frames the conflict in Ukraine as a war orchestrated and fueled by the West, with Ukraine acting as its instrument, which aligns with the narrative that Ukraine is controlled by Western powers."

      "evidence_quote": "But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition... It’s just Ukrainian lives after all;",
      "reasoning": "This statement portrays the conflict as a protracted, unwinnable war of attrition where Ukrainian lives are being sacrificed for a futile cause, emphasizing a sense of hopelessness and lack of positive future for Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a third world war, framing the conflict's expansion as a deliberate act of globalizing war, which aligns with the subnarrative of warning against actions that risk WW3."

      "evidence_quote": "But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition, then expand it to Asia.",
      "reasoning": "The statement explicitly claims that the war will be expanded from Eastern Europe to Asia, implying an imminent threat of conflict spreading to other countries, which matches the subnarrative definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "Alarmingly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Nato as playing a “bridge” between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific theatres.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests NATO is positioning itself to take a direct, expanded role by bridging conflicts in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, implying a shift towards direct intervention in a broader theater."

      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by accusing the West of scapegoating China to justify and prolong the conflict, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting the specific definitions of the other subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "Given his obvious mental decline, US President Joe Biden may be forgiven for claiming to ABC News’ host George Stephanopoulos that he was indispensable: “You know, not only am I campaigning, but I’m running the world.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits a specific Western media interview (ABC News) by framing the President's claim as a symptom of 'mental decline', thereby casting doubt on the credibility and seriousness of the media platform hosting and reporting on such statements, which supports the broader narrative of distrust towards media."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western military support for Ukraine is depleting their own arsenals ('emptying their own weapons warehouses') and is failing to achieve victory ('still not winning'), which catastrophizes the negative, self-harming effects of Western intervention."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western/American actions are leading to catastrophic global consequences—specifically, the expansion of conflict and the risk of a third world war. This is a negative consequence for the West and the world, but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the destruction of 'street zone sectioning barriers' as a form of resistance, implying these barriers are part of a climate policy (like low-traffic neighborhoods) that is being actively opposed and criticized for its impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' directly challenges the validity and rationality of the climate movement, portraying it as an irrational force that requires 'resistance'."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con...",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate change as 'The Climate Con' (a con or fraud) is a direct attempt to downplay its scientific reality and seriousness, framing it as a deceptive scheme rather than a genuine issue."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate policies as irrational and misguided, implying they are not a sensible or effective response to climate issues."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "The text labels climate action as 'The Climate Con', a term implying a fraudulent scheme, and directly solicits financial support to fight it, suggesting the policies are driven by deceptive profit motives rather than genuine environmental concern."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "This describes direct, illegal action against a specific climate policy (traffic filtering/zoning), which criticizes the policy's implementation and social acceptance but does not directly address its effectiveness, economic impact, or profit motive as defined in the other subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames the climate movement's agenda as irrational and hysterical, aligning with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist and exaggerating the issue."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "The repeated labeling of climate action as 'The Climate Con' directly alleges the movement is a fraudulent scheme or scam, implying it is driven by deceit and ulterior motives, which matches the definition of the movement being corrupt."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s very inspiring to see the people of the UK take matters into their own hands. This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly supports the parent narrative by celebrating active resistance against climate policies, but the specific argument—that direct action and civil disobedience are a justified response—does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate change action as irrational or extreme, which is a form of downplaying its seriousness and legitimacy, but does not fit any of the more specific scientific or impact-based subnarratives provided."

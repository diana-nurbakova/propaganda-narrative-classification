      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet... Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly highlights adverse economic outcomes (high electricity prices, inflation) for Germany and other European nations as a consequence of the disruption of Russian gas, which is framed as a result of the sanctions regime and geopolitical crisis related to the Russia-Ukraine war."

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock...",
      "reasoning": "The text lists the war, Western sanctions, and pipeline sabotage as causes of Germany's energy crisis. By grouping the war with the sanctions and sabotage as causative factors, it implicitly shifts blame away from Russia's invasion as the primary cause, instead framing the Western response as equally or more responsible for the negative consequences."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question directly criticizes and discredits the competence and judgment of German (and by extension, Western) leadership, blaming them for the economic suffering through their 'idiocy' in energy and climate policy."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "This is not present in the text. The text criticizes Western (German) leadership and policies, it does not praise them.",
      "reasoning": "The narrative 'Overpraising the West' is not applicable. The text is highly critical of German and Western energy policies and leadership, describing them as 'misguided', 'near-sighted', 'self-sabotaging', and 'idiocy'. There is no excessive or undue praise for Western virtues or accomplishments."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes Germany's energy crisis and high costs to the Western sanctions regime against Russia, framing the sanctions as a self-inflicted wound that forces Germany into an emergency situation, which matches the definition of catastrophizing the negative effects of Western sanctions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West by detailing severe economic harm (high electricity prices, worse inflation) specifically in European nations due to the disruption of Russian gas supplies, a consequence of the geopolitical conflict. This economic harm is a distinct negative consequence not covered by the 'sanctions backfire' or 'refugee flows' subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly blames the economic hardship on the Western sanctions regime against Russia, framing it as a primary cause of Germany's energy crisis, thereby shifting responsibility for the conflict's negative consequences away from Russia and onto the West."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What President Donald Trump was referring to in 2018 was Germany’s increasing dependence on Russian gas, which in turn resulted from “green” energy policies implemented over the previous decade.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by blaming Germany's pre-war energy policy (green fanaticism) for creating the vulnerability that led to crisis, indirectly shifting blame for the war's economic impact away from the invader (Russia) and onto internal political decisions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a division within the EU, specifically between nations that were heavily reliant on Russian gas and those that were not, suggesting the bloc is not a unified entity with shared interests or outcomes, which aligns with the subnarrative of a divided EU."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This statement presents a core Western European power, Germany, as economically crippled and failing due to its own policies, which implicitly portrays the West as weakened and not as potent as it once was."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock...",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the Western sanctions regime as a direct cause of Germany's severe energy and economic crisis, implying the West's reaction (sanctions) has led to self-inflicted, disproportionate harm to its own economies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The proposed solution of German leaders has been for its citizens to consume less and its factories to produce less or move manufacturing offshore. But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders?",
      "reasoning": "This frames the Western (German) policy response to the Ukraine war crisis as an act of self-sabotaging 'idiocy' that harms its own people, implicitly arguing that the West's actions (driven by green ideology and sanctions) are not about helping Ukraine but are misguided pursuits that damage Western interests."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s beleaguered citizens appear to have had enough of this disaster. Political change is in the winds. The populist conservative party, Alternative for Germany, has just emerged as Germany’s second strongest party...",
      "reasoning": "This describes a political backlash within Germany, a key Western supporter of Ukraine, fueled by economic hardship attributed to the energy crisis linked to the war and sanctions. It supports the narrative that Western populations are becoming fatigued with the costs of the conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the Western sanctions regime as a necessary and morally justified response to the Russia-Ukraine war, implicitly placing the West on the 'right side' of the conflict by depicting its actions (sanctions) as defensive measures to protect values and security, despite the negative consequences described for Germany."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity derived from world-class coal and nuclear power.",
      "reasoning": "This statement overpraises the historical technological and industrial prowess of the West (specifically Germany) by describing its former energy infrastructure as 'world-class,' 'highly efficient,' and 'inexpensive,' creating a stark, favorable contrast with its current state which is blamed on misguided 'green' policies, thus supporting the overarching narrative of Western superiority now being undermined."

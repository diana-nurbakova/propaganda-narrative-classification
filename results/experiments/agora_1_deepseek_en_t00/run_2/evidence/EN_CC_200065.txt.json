      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly raises doubt about the scientific basis for claims of long-term temperature records by highlighting the short duration of instrumental data collection, which aligns with the narrative's definition of casting doubt on scientific methods and data."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses a NASA statement to question the validity and comparability of paleoclimate proxy data, which is a core tactic of the 'Questioning the measurements and science' narrative."

      "evidence_quote": "Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert...",
      "reasoning": "Describing the claims as 'extravagant' frames the climate movement's statements as exaggerated and lacking in restraint, which is a form of criticism targeting their motives and impact."

      "evidence_quote": "The piece echoes claims by the once prestigious Lancet medical journal, which has averred...",

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by casting doubt on the claims of historical temperature extremes, but its specific argument—that the claims are invalid because instrumental records are too recent—does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by casting doubt on the claims of historical temperature extremes, arguing they are based on an insufficiently long instrumental record. It does not fit the specific definitions of questioning data reliability, denying temperature increase, denying the greenhouse effect, or attacking the scientific community's reliability, but it clearly questions the scientific basis of the measurements."

      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question dismissively implies the climate movement's narrative is unscientific and driven by a desire for a compelling 'story' rather than facts, which criticizes the movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "reasoning": "The opening phrase 'Climate alarmists' is a pejorative label, and the description of their claims as 'lamenting' and the specific quote about 'the hottest day in thousands of years' frames the climate movement as exaggerating and being overly dramatic about temperature data."

      "reasoning": "This concluding rhetorical question directly accuses the climate movement (the source of the 'story') of ignoring or misrepresenting scientific data to support their narrative. It criticizes the movement's methodology and credibility, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the more specific 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem' categories."

      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question broadly criticizes the scientific institutions and authorities (like NASA, Copernicus, and the journals cited) for allegedly prioritizing a narrative over scientific rigor, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions but does not fit a more specific subcategory like 'Criticism of the EU' or 'Criticism of national governments'."

      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The quote casts doubt on long-term climate claims by emphasizing the short duration of instrumental records, implying that the 'hottest day in thousands of years' claim is unreliable because we lack direct data for that entire period. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate change is a natural cycle and that current observations are insufficient to prove an unprecedented trend."

      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question dismisses the scientific claims about record temperatures as mere storytelling or alarmism. It supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change by suggesting the evidence is fabricated or exaggerated for narrative purposes, which is a form of downplaying not captured by the other specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "Appearing on a state TV show Sunday Evening With Vladimir Soloviev, political scientist and Professor of Communications Dmitry Evstafiev argued: “Right now, President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin’s third proposal to the Ukrainian leadership is on the table. This, of course, is a demonstration of his greatest respect and—I would even say—of love by our President towards the Ukrainian people.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Putin's actions as stemming from 'greatest respect' and 'love,' which is a positive, glorifying portrayal of Russia's leader and his intentions."

      "evidence_quote": "He argued: “Here’s what will be on the table after our victory... The dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way. Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko... Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko. Extradition of various oligarchs... We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself... The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.”",
      "reasoning": "This extensive list details severe, punitive demands and consequences (dissolution of NATO, reparations, seizure of property) that Russia intends to impose on the West following a victory, highlighting negative outcomes for Western interests."

This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly uses the term 'Banderites' to label Ukrainian opponents, linking them to a historical figure associated with ultranationalism, and the text clarifies this is used as a synonym for 'Nazis,' directly supporting the subnarrative of associating Ukraine with Nazism."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as militarily superior and confident enough to achieve its goals against the West without resorting to its ultimate weapons, which is a form of praise for Russian capability that doesn't fit the more specific subnarrative definitions."

      "evidence_quote": "Multiple state TV shows emphasized the reluctance on the part of the United States and NATO to intervene against Russia’s bloody invasion of its neighbor, presenting it as the proof that the Kremlin can go to any lengths to emerge victorious.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the West's (U.S. and NATO) reluctance to directly intervene militarily as proof of weakness, suggesting the Kremlin can act with impunity because the West lacks the potency or will to stop it."

      "reasoning": "This direct quote claims that the American public is indifferent to Ukraine's fate, implying Western support is not driven by genuine concern for Ukraine but by other, likely self-serving, interests of the State Department."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "Olga Skabeeva, the host of a state TV show 60 Minutes, intentionally distorted the statements of White House press secretary Jen Psaki. On Friday, Skabeeva claimed: “Jennifer Psaki’s statement said that no matter what Putin does in Ukraine—whether he uses biological weapons or drops a nuclear bomb—the United States won’t get involved.”",
      "reasoning": "By fabricating a claim that the U.S. said it wouldn't intervene even if Russia used WMDs, the narrative suggests the West's actual reaction (sanctions, support) is disproportionate and hysterical, as Russia's actions (framed as a 'special operation') supposedly do not warrant such a response."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West by presenting a catastrophic ultimatum: the West must either pay reparations (a financial/political negative consequence) or face nuclear war (an existential negative consequence). This goes beyond the specific 'sanctions backfire' or 'refugee flows' subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to negotiate with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is being packaged as a sign of his love and good will, and not the consequence of mounting losses and humiliating defeats faced by the Russian military in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that the Russian military is facing 'mounting losses and humiliating defeats,' which aligns with the definition of suggesting a significant decline in its effectiveness and strength."

      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on the outcome of the war, predicting a Russian victory and Western defeat/concessions. It supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes but does not fit the specific definitions of army collapse or losing territories; it is a broader, speculative claim about the conflict's end result."

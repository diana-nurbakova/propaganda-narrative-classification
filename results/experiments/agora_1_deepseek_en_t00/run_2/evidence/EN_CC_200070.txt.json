      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Mayor Garcetti's competence and priorities by contrasting his international travel with domestic crises, challenging his integrity and effectiveness as a leader and the institution of his office."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific climate policy (the Green New Deal) by highlighting its political opposition and electoral failure, suggesting it is not achieving its intended goals, which aligns with the definition of policies being ineffective."

      "evidence_quote": "The C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action – it’s a chance to elevate the solutions cities are deploying at a neighborhood level that have a real impact on people’s daily lives.",
      "reasoning": "The article frames the summit and Garcetti's participation as hypocritical and performative, implying the action is for show or political gain rather than genuine environmental concern, especially when contrasted with the carbon cost of his travel. The overall tone suggests the policies and summits are driven by motives other than pure environmentalism."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes climate policies and actors by highlighting hypocrisy and poor prioritization (choosing a carbon-intensive trip over remote participation and domestic issues). It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit neatly into the specific definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

      "reasoning": "This statement expresses disapproval of the decision-making and actions of the summit organizers (an institutional body) for not choosing a remote format, which is a criticism of institutional approach but does not fit the specific definitions for EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures."

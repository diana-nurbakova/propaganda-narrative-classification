      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policy (in this case, guidelines on washing frequency) as an unjust infringement on fundamental personal rights, directly criticizing its impact and motives."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the WEF, accusing it of hypocrisy and of targeting ordinary citizens while protecting the elite."
    },

      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The language ('ordered compliant governments', 'move towards a future') suggests a covert, top-down agenda by a powerful globalist group (the WEF) to impose restrictive controls on the public."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "The text connects the WEF's climate-related policy advocacy (restricting laundry/clothing) with its praise for China's model and its gathering of global elites, implying environmental policies are tools for advancing a specific geopolitical and economic agenda."

      "reasoning": "This quote contrasts the proposed policy (restricting laundry) with the massive carbon footprint of the elites promoting it, implying the policy is hypocritical and ineffective at addressing the real sources of emissions."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by portraying climate policy as an extreme, rights-stripping measure that infringes on personal hygiene and dignity, which is not captured by the more specific economic or profit-driven subnarratives."

The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The text directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and 'ordering' governments, portraying it as an overreaching authority imposing unreasonable climate-related policies on the public."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities (the WEF) but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives. It accuses the WEF of protecting elite privileges while designing environmental policy to infringe on citizens' rights, which is a broader criticism of its motives and governance."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups by highlighting their hypocrisy and suggesting the climate rules are not applied fairly, but it does not fit neatly into the 'Blaming global elites' or 'Hidden motives' definitions as it focuses on elite hypocrisy as a separate argument within the broader conspiratorial theme."

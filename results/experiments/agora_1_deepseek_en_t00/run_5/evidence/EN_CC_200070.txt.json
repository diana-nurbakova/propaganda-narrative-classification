      "evidence_quote": "White Garcetti was away, Los Angeles continued to struggle with the high crime and homelessness that have come to define his legacy, as well as a crisis in the City Council triggered by racist comments from City Council members within Garcetti’s party.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Mayor Garcetti's competence and priorities by contrasting his international travel with domestic crises, challenging his integrity and effectiveness as a leader and the institution of his office."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific climate policy (the Green New Deal) by highlighting its political opposition and electoral failure, suggesting it is not achieving its intended goals, which aligns with the definition of policies being ineffective."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action – it’s a chance to elevate the solutions cities are deploying at a neighborhood level that have a real impact on people’s daily lives.",
      "reasoning": "The article frames the summit and Garcetti's attendance as hypocritical and performative, implying the action is for show or status ('elevate the solutions') rather than genuine environmental concern, especially when contrasted with the carbon cost of his travel. This aligns with the narrative that such policies/actions are driven by motives other than genuine concern, such as political or corporate gain/PR."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate policy actor (the mayor) for personal hypocrisy and poor prioritization (neglecting local issues like crime and homelessness). It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies/actors but does not fit the definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or being for profit. It is a distinct argument about hypocrisy and misaligned priorities."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Mayor Eric Garcetti's performance and legacy, focusing on domestic failures (crime, homelessness) and a political crisis within his party, thereby discrediting him as a political figure in the context of his climate-focused trip."

      "reasoning": "This statement expresses disapproval of the decision-making and actions of the authorities (the summit organizers and/or Garcetti) by questioning the necessity of the in-person event, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit the specific definitions targeting the EU, international entities, national governments, or political organizations/figures."

      "evidence_quote": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined a “global coalition of mayors” at a summit on climate change this week in Buenos Aires, Argentina, burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights hypocrisy and ulterior motives by suggesting the mayor's actions (flying to a climate summit) contradict the movement's stated goals, implying the movement is not genuinely committed but engages in performative, self-serving, or corrupt practices."

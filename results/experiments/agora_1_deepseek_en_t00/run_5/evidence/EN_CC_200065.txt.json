      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly raises doubt about the scientific basis for claims of long-term temperature records by highlighting the short duration of instrumental data collection, which aligns with the narrative's definition of casting doubt on scientific methods and data."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses a NASA statement to question the validity and comparability of paleoclimate proxy data, which is a core tactic of the 'Questioning the measurements and science' narrative."

      "evidence_quote": "Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert...",

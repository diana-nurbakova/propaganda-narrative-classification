      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock",
      "reasoning": "The quote lists the war, Western sanctions, and pipeline sabotage as causes of Germany's energy crisis, framing the negative consequences as resulting from actions other than Russia's initial invasion, thereby shifting blame away from the invader."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet... Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly highlights severe adverse economic outcomes (high electricity prices, inflation) for Germany and other European nations as a direct result of the disruption of Russian gas, which aligns with the narrative of predicting or reporting negative impacts on Western countries."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question directly criticizes and portrays Western (German) leadership as incompetent and foolish, which fits the narrative of discrediting Western governments and their policies."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly identifies the Western sanctions regime as a primary cause of Germany's energy crisis, shifting the responsibility for the negative economic consequences away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and onto the actions of the United States and the West."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What President Donald Trump was referring to in 2018 was Germany’s increasing dependence on Russian gas, which in turn resulted from “green” energy policies implemented over the previous decade.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by blaming Germany's pre-war energy policy (its 'green fanaticism') for creating the vulnerability that led to the current crisis, thereby framing the war's economic impact as a consequence of misguided Western/European policy choices rather than Russian aggression."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing. As a result, Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links the Western sanctions regime (and related events) to severe negative economic consequences for Germany, specifically skyrocketing energy prices, which is a classic example of the 'sanctions will backfire' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West (specifically Germany) but does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows. It catastrophizes the consequences of Germany's energy/climate policies, which are framed as being intertwined with the geopolitical response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, thus serving as a remainder argument for the parent narrative."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a division within Europe, specifically between nations that were heavily reliant on Russian gas and those that were not, suggesting the EU is not a unified bloc and its members are suffering unevenly due to their differing policies and dependencies."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This statement presents a core Western European power, Germany, as economically crippled and weakened due to its own policy failures, which implicitly supports the narrative of Western weakness and decline."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West... Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock... Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the Western sanctions regime as the direct cause of severe economic hardship for Germany, portraying the West's collective action as a disproportionate and self-destructive overreaction that harms its own members more than its intended target."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The proposed solution of German leaders has been for its citizens to consume less and its factories to produce less or move manufacturing offshore. But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders?",
      "reasoning": "This frames the West's (and specifically German leadership's) policy response to the Ukraine war as an act of self-sabotage driven by ideological 'idiocy' rather than a genuine concern for Ukraine's fate, implying the interests of the German people are being sacrificed for a misguided cause."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s beleaguered citizens appear to have had enough of this disaster. Political change is in the winds. The populist conservative party, Alternative for Germany, has just emerged as Germany’s second strongest party... One of the party’s main selling points is that it’s 'an aggressive opponent of the government’s energy and climate policy.'",
      "reasoning": "This describes a political backlash within Germany, a key Western supporter of Ukraine, where citizens are 'beleaguered' and a rising populist party is gaining traction by opposing the very policies (like sanctions-driven energy scarcity) linked to the West's support for Ukraine, signaling growing domestic fatigue and disinterest."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy and action by contrasting Western (German) self-destructive 'virtue signaling' with the pragmatic, growth-focused policies of non-Western powers like China, arguing the West's approach is foolish and puts it at a competitive disadvantage."

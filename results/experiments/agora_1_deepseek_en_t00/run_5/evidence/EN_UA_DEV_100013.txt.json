      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "Before reading out an Open Letter to the Ukrainian government, SEP National Secretary Chris Marsden explained that the new Ukrainian ambassador to the UK is Valery Zaluzhny, “who is the former head of the Ukrainian armed forces and is well aware of the crimes of the Ukrainian regime of which we speak.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly labels the Ukrainian government as a 'regime' and accuses it of 'crimes', which is a clear attempt to undermine the legitimacy and moral standing of the Ukrainian state."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "As with other embassies on this international day of protest, staff refused to take receipt of the letter, hiding inside locked gates in a clear demonstration of the nakedly criminal character of the Ukrainian regime and its frame-up of Bogdan.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly characterizes the Ukrainian state as having a 'nakedly criminal character', which is a direct and severe attack intended to discredit the entire Ukrainian government."

      "evidence_quote": "Zaluzhny is a fitting representative, with blood on his hands.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase demonizes a high-ranking Ukrainian official by attributing direct responsibility for deaths, painting the Ukrainian leadership in a violently negative light."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "The WSWS noted of Zaluzhny, “Above all, he has established a close relationship with the country’s far-right. He has publicly expressed admiration for the Ukrainian fascist leader Stepan Bandera and has been photographed repeatedly with far-right paraphernalia.”",
      "reasoning": "This associates a key Ukrainian military and diplomatic figure with fascism and far-right extremism, aiming to discredit Ukraine by linking its leadership to historically toxic ideologies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Zaluzhny now serves as a point man between the Ukrainian regime and its military and British imperialism, with the full support of his arch rival.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'British imperialism' is used pejoratively to criticize and discredit the role of the United Kingdom, framing its support for Ukraine as a form of imperialist aggression rather than legitimate alliance."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "That the UK was chosen as Zaluzhny’s destination after being deposed speaks to British imperialism’s leading role in the NATO-run war, as an anti-Russian provocateur, supplier of advanced weaponry and trainer of Ukrainian troops.",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits Western (specifically British) diplomatic and military support by labeling it as 'imperialism' and characterizing its actions as 'provocation', suggesting malign intent behind NATO's involvement."

      "evidence_quote": "That he was appointed ambassador to the UK in March confirms the SEP’s insistence that a major escalation of NATO’s proxy war against Russia is being prepared.",
      "reasoning": "This explicitly identifies NATO as the party preparing for war escalation ('proxy war against Russia'), attributing aggressive intent and responsibility to the West rather than to Russia, the invading power."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The appointment of Zaluzhny to London ensures that Britain remains a centre of intrigue to implement the most brutal and dangerous war policy since 1945 with no public discussion and no democratic mandate whatsoever.",
      "reasoning": "This predicts severe negative consequences for Britain, portraying it as being led into a 'brutal and dangerous' war policy undemocratically, which aligns with the narrative of warning about adverse outcomes for Western nations."

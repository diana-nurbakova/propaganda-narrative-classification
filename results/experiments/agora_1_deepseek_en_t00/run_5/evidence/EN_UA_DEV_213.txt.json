      "evidence_quote": "US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war",
      "reasoning": "The headline and core argument directly attribute the cause of potential war to the actions of the US and NATO, shifting blame away from Russia as the potential invader."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia.",

      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "The text labels Western media as 'filthy pro-imperialist,' directly questioning its integrity and reliability, and attributing war talk to a propaganda effort."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames Russia's potential actions as a justified and defensive response to NATO expansion, portraying Russia as a nation under threat and victimized by Western aggression."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",

      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the conflict and its escalation to the United States and its European allies, portraying them as the deliberate instigators seeking war, which aligns with the definition of blaming the West as the aggressors."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This statement suggests that allegations of Russian aggression are a cover for a false-flag operation by Ukrainian forces trained by the US, thereby blaming the West and its Ukrainian proxy for provoking conflict."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago... Russia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.",
      "reasoning": "This frames the current crisis as a consequence of NATO expansion and military posturing, portraying Russia as a victim reacting to Western encirclement and aggression, thus blaming the West for the conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the war on others (US media and domestic crisis motives) but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions, as it introduces a distinct motive of domestic distraction."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses Western governments and media of fabricating and exaggerating the threat of a Russian invasion without evidence, framing their reaction as disproportionate and alarmist."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that Western support for Ukraine is not genuine concern for the country, but rather a 'pretext' for their own geopolitical confrontation with Russia, prioritizing their interests over Ukraine's fate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted. It writes: 'With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.'",
      "reasoning": "The text cites and endorses the view that the diplomatic window is closing or was never open, thereby discrediting the potential for diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western motives, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives. It presents Western actions as a cynical ploy to divert from domestic crises, which is a distinct argument not covered by the other definitions."

      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses major Western media institutions (NYT, WaPo) of being part of a disinformation campaign, presenting lies as fact to manipulate public opinion, which aligns with the definition of Western media as an instrument of propaganda."

      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly discredits media across the Atlantic as 'filthy pro-imperialist,' supporting the parent narrative of distrust towards media. It does not specifically target Ukrainian media nor does it solely fit the 'Western media is an instrument of propaganda' subnarrative as it includes a more general, vitriolic condemnation of media as a whole entity serving imperialist interests, which is a distinct argument not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence",
      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Russia's posture and potential actions as a necessary and defensive reaction to NATO's expansion and aggressive intentions, justifying them solely as a response to an external threat."

      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented...",
      "reasoning": "This quote characterizes the Western narrative about Russian aggression as a baseless, media-driven disinformation campaign, implying the negative reaction is rooted in a biased, anti-Russian perspective rather than facts."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests Ukraine is not a sovereign actor but a proxy for the West, with its special forces being used to stage provocations against Russia, painting Ukraine as a hostile, extremist element directed by external powers."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as a victim of Western/NATO ultimatums that infringe on its sovereignty and treat it like a defeated nation, a theme not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that NATO should take a more direct and aggressive military action (delivering lethal weapons) in the conflict, which aligns with the subnarrative definition of suggesting NATO ought to or will take direct action."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by accusing the US and NATO of deliberately seeking war, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about WW3, attacking other countries, nuclear weapons, or direct NATO intervention as defined."

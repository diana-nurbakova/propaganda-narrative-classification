      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments. This perception presents a significant challenge in encouraging people to seek necessary mental health treatment.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights a negative perception of Ukraine's mental health system, framing it as a legacy of Soviet-era oppression and as ineffective or prison-like. This undermines the legitimacy and functionality of a key Ukrainian societal institution."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The full-scale invasion has magnified Ukraine's pre-existing challenges and introduced larger societal issues... Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",
      "reasoning": "This statement emphasizes the profound and ongoing psychological trauma, the magnification of societal issues, and explicitly states 'there is no end in sight,' which evokes fear and anxiety about the war's indefinite continuation and its severe consequences."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly portrays a bleak, hopeless future for Ukraine, stating there is no end in sight to the war and that the population's mindset is defined by an inability to plan ahead, which aligns with the definition of portraying Ukraine as having no viable perspectives or positive future."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Those who fled to western Ukraine speak to the extremely high rent prices due to high demand, and government aid doesn’t help much. Those registered as internally displaced people (IDPs) can receive a monthly allowance of UAH 2,000 ($52.77) per adult and UAH 3,000 ($79.15) per child from the program that was created by the government.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the effectiveness of Ukrainian government aid programs for IDPs, implying they are insufficient and unhelpful, which serves to delegitimize and portray government policies as incompetent."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This crisis in healthcare is set against a backdrop of long-standing distrust in mental health services in Ukraine, a legacy of the Soviet era when the psychiatric system was used to oppress dissidents and enemies of the state. A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by highlighting deep-seated societal and institutional failures (a dysfunctional, oppressive legacy system) that undermine the country's stability and well-being. It does not cleanly fit the more specific subnarratives like discrediting the nation, government, or military, but it broadly discredits Ukrainian societal structures and resilience."

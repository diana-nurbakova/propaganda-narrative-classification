      "reasoning": "This direct quote provides a severe, derogatory criticism of Western (specifically American) society and character, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting the West by attacking its moral standing and people."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "Will they resort to nuclear weapons to even out the war?",
      "reasoning": "This question, posed in the introductory text, directly evokes fear and anxiety about the potential for nuclear escalation, which is a core element of the 'Amplifying war-related fears' narrative."

      "evidence_quote": "Scott Ritter: Russia is Winning",

      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses the West (specifically America) of consistently and disproportionately exaggerating threats from Russia and China, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West's reaction as disproportionate."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death. The question is, why the desperation to keep the war going?",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the Western media's framing (and by extension, Western political interests) is deliberately prolonging the war in Ukraine, causing more death, rather than genuinely caring about a peaceful resolution for Ukraine's sake."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations",

      "evidence_quote": "amerikans are the greatest pigs on the planet…and that is in the most derogitive term you can imagine.. absolute pigs",
      "reasoning": "This quote contains a broad, vitriolic condemnation of Americans (representing the West) that supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West but does not fit neatly into any of the more specific diplomatic subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, etc., but a general moral/character attack)."

      "reasoning": "This quote argues that Western (specifically American) demonization and overreaction to Russia is a persistent, misguided policy. It implies that the West's aggressive stance, which includes sanctions and confrontation, is based on a false premise and is therefore a self-inflicted negative consequence of its own propaganda and fear-mongering."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly and no more of month after month of promises from Trump or threats from the east….POOF..it’s all over …thanks mostly to un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries” they are proving the worst of the worst of humanity",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses a nihilistic desire for nuclear war as a release from the conflict, explicitly blaming 'un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries”' for creating a situation so dire that total annihilation seems preferable. It supports the parent narrative by catastrophizing the West's role in escalating the conflict to a potentially civilization-ending level, which is a negative consequence not covered by the more specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed",
      "evidence_quote": "Will they resort to nuclear weapons to even out the war?",
      "reasoning": "This direct question explicitly raises the possibility of nuclear weapon use in the context of the Ukraine war, evoking fear about that specific outcome."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by presenting a catastrophic, world-ending nuclear war as a seemingly inevitable or even desirable outcome to end the suffering, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the more specific definitions of Russia attacking other countries, causing WW3, or NATO intervention."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "Another must listen to interview with information that you are missing from the corporation propaganda western media",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly labels Western media as 'corporation propaganda,' framing it as a tool that withholds truthful information and serves a propagandistic purpose, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Western media institutions as instruments of propaganda."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by accusing Western media of a specific, harmful misrepresentation (framing Russia as losing) that has dire consequences (prolonging war and death). It discredits Western media's reporting but does not fit the more specific definitions of being an 'instrument of propaganda' or targeting Ukrainian media; it is a distinct argument about the media's role in prolonging conflict."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia is Winning",
      "reasoning": "The title directly states 'Russia is Winning,' which is a speculative statement about the war's outcome, implying the opposing force (Ukraine) is losing or collapsing."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death",
      "reasoning": "This statement counters a speculated outcome (Russia losing) and implies a different, more favorable outcome for Russia, which is a form of speculating on war results that doesn't fit the other specific subnarratives."

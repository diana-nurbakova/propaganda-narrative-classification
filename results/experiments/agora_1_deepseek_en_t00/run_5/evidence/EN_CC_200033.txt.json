    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism. Run your eye down the contributors to The Climate Book and you can see who she’s been reading: Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Naomi Klein. For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the climate movement, represented by Thunberg and her cited authors, as being driven by a specific anti-capitalist, left-wing political ideology rather than genuine environmental concern, challenging its motives and integrity."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This direct quote from the text criticizes a major international climate policy forum (COP) by questioning its effectiveness and motives, labeling it a deceptive scam."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "The concluding statement explicitly claims that the climate agenda is not about the environment but is a tool for a geopolitical and cultural objective: dismantling Western civilization and imposing a specific political system."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement suggests the true, hidden purpose of the climate change agenda is not environmental protection but the advancement of a radical political ideology, implying a deceptive scheme by its proponents."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'human alarm bell' and 'climate Cassandra' directly frames Thunberg and, by extension, the climate movement she represents, as exaggerating and being overly dramatic about the climate crisis, which aligns with the definition of the movement being 'alarmist'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto.",
      "reasoning": "The description of Thunberg's manifesto as 'demented' is a direct personal attack on her character and mental state, which fits the definition of an ad hominem attack on a key activist."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "Labeling the COP (Conference of the Parties, a key climate movement institution) as a 'scam' that facilitates dishonesty and unethical practices implies the broader climate movement is engaged in corrupt or deceptive activities."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by alleging its true goal is not environmental protection but the advancement of a radical left-wing political ideology. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of being alarmist, corrupt, or a personal attack."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames a major international climate policy framework (COP) as a deceptive scheme for financial or reputational gain ('greenwashing'), aligning with the definition that climate policies are driven by profit rather than genuine environmental goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism... For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism... The only solution to this state of emergency is for rich countries to immediately abandon economic expansion as a social goal.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes climate activism and policy advocacy by portraying it as a radical, anti-capitalist political ideology (Thunbergism, de-growth) rather than a legitimate environmental effort. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions about ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive; it instead argues the policies are a cover for a hostile political agenda."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Normal” was the “system” which gave us the climate crisis, a system of “colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide”, of “racist, oppressive extractionism”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the climate crisis and the system causing it in terms of colonialism and imperialism, suggesting that green activism is a response to and a critique of a system seen as a modern form of colonial exploitation."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a major international climate institution (COP) as fundamentally dishonest and exploitative, supporting the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments, but it does not fit the specific definitions of 'abusive/exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' as cleanly."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that the stated goal of the climate agenda is a cover for a different, radical political motive, aligning with the definition of the climate action push being driven by ulterior motives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the offshoot of which, Just Stop Oil, is currently engaged in blocking roads across London, admitted in his own words that his movement 'isn’t about the climate.'",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by suggesting a prominent climate movement is secretly about something else, but the specific motive described (tearing down western capitalism) is more about a broad ideological overthrow than a secret scheme by a powerful elite group, fitting the 'Other' category."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia, the invader, and onto the West, framing Western actions as the primary obstacle to peace."

      "reasoning": "The statement criticizes Western (European) policy, portraying it as a malicious and wasteful 'proxy war' driven by American interests, which undermines the legitimacy and intentions of Western diplomatic and military support."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "\"We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly evokes fear of a catastrophic, pan-Slavic retaliation against Western Europe if support for Ukraine continues, fitting the definition of amplifying war-related fears through a direct threat of severe consequences."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by framing Western military aid as the cause of Slavic deaths, implicitly shifting blame from the invader (Russia) to the West's support for Ukraine. It does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as neatly, as it focuses on a pan-Slavic victimhood and threat narrative."

      "evidence_quote": "“The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies. Don’t expect the citizens of the EU to support you in this; you speak like crazed maniacs.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims Western support for Ukraine is driven by the self-interest of arms manufacturers, not by genuine concern for Ukraine's fate."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a catastrophic escalation, suggesting that continued Western support for Ukraine will provoke a unified Slavic (implied Russian-led) retaliation that will destroy Western Europe, which is a clear warning against upsetting Russia and its sphere, aligning with the fear of causing a wider, potentially world-scale war."

      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by framing the conflict as a destructive, externally-driven proxy war that is against European interests and is actively destroying Ukraine. It supports the parent narrative of amplifying fears about the war's continuation but does not fit the specific definitions of nuclear use, NATO intervention, or an attack on other countries, nor is it solely about the risk of WWIII as defined."

      "evidence_quote": "“He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a ‘US problem.’”",
      "reasoning": "The statement that the EU has 'no chance of winning against Russia' portrays the conflict as unwinnable for Ukraine's supporters, implying Ukraine's situation is hopeless and further resistance is futile."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies.” and “helping to destroy Ukraine.”",
      "reasoning": "These phrases support the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by portraying Western support as cynical, profit-driven, and ultimately harmful to Ukraine itself ('destroy Ukraine'), which does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarrative definitions."

      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly attacks the character and legitimacy of the Ukrainian state by asserting widespread, pre-existing corruption, which aligns with the narrative of undermining Ukraine's societal and governmental integrity."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western (specifically U.S.) policy and aid efforts by framing them as enabling massive fraud and irresponsible distribution of weapons, thereby discrediting Western actions and diplomacy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill...",
      "reasoning": "This statement predicts a negative outcome for Western (U.S.) interests, specifically a loss of public support and willingness to fund the defense of Ukraine, which is framed as a direct consequence of the reported corruption."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly delegitimizes the Ukrainian government and its policies by asserting widespread, pre-existing corruption as a universally accepted fact, implying systemic incompetence and dishonesty."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities",
      "evidence_quote": "War is a business, and the business of war is going on in Ukraine. The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Ukraine as a center for illegal war profiteering, massive fraud, and the potential diversion of weapons, aligning with the subnarrative that Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities."

      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by arguing that revelations of corruption are undermining Western public and political support for Ukraine, which is a discrediting effect not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western (specifically American) support for Ukraine is driven by self-interest (protecting Europe/NATO from Russia) rather than genuine concern for Ukraine's people or sovereignty, fitting the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote claims that revelations of corruption are causing American public support and willingness to fund Ukraine to wane, directly supporting the subnarrative that the West is becoming fatigued or disinterested in supporting Ukraine."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "Bulgaria’s only gas oil refinery is owned by Russian Lukoil, and Bulgaria is fully entitled to continue to operate this refinery with Russian oil because it has an exemption from EU sanctions. So, yes, essentially, Ukraine was buying “discounted Russian diesel”, but in a very indirect way...",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a consequence of Western sanctions policy: an EU member state (Bulgaria) has an exemption allowing it to process Russian oil, and the resulting fuel is then sold to Ukraine, indirectly funding Russia. This illustrates how sanctions can be circumvented or have unintended, counterproductive effects, aligning with the 'sanctions will backfire' subnarrative."

The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that revelations of corruption in Ukraine (aided by Western funds) will lead to a negative consequence for the West: a reduction in American public and taxpayer support for the defense of Ukraine, thereby weakening Western resolve and strategic position. This supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West but does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

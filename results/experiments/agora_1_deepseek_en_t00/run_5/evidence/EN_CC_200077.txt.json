      "evidence_quote": "By depriving rural residents of their right to just say no to green energy scams, the state-level 'greenies' who control California, Illinois, Michigan and New York are pandering to corporate interests while lining their own pockets, all at the expense of their constituents.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the implementation and motives behind state-level green energy policies, framing them as 'scams' that serve corporate and political interests at the expense of local communities."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Each of these so-called 'blue' states ... is controlled by far-left politicians who are in bed with the green energy industry. Local governments in these four left-leaning states no longer have authority over their own land when it comes to the green projects being pushed by state-level bureaucrats, many of whom have sold their souls to 'renewable' energy projects...",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the integrity and motives of state politicians and bureaucrats, accusing them of being corruptly aligned with industry and stripping local authorities of their power."

      "evidence_quote": "All that taxpayer cash being pumped into the green economy, supposedly to fight not just inflation but also climate change, is being used to drive family farmers off their land so it can be turned into another wind or solar farm, or perhaps the next carbon capture pipeline.",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses skepticism and criticism of green technologies (wind, solar, carbon capture), framing their deployment as harmful and destructive to American farmers and communities."

      "reasoning": "While not explicitly naming a 'secret' group, the narrative of a hidden plot is implied by framing major legislation (the Inflation Reduction Act) as a covert scheme to funnel vast sums of public money to powerful corporate interests under the guise of climate action."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes climate policies (green energy) by alleging they benefit foreign adversaries and undermine national security/independence. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the definitions of the specific subnarratives provided (ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive)."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the national government (the 'Biden regime') for enacting a policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) that is portrayed as harming American citizens to benefit corporations, fitting the definition of disapproving of how national governments handle climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes state-level bureaucratic institutions and authorities (state-level bureaucrats) for overriding local governance and being corruptly aligned with industry. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives targeting the EU, international entities, national governments, or political organizations/figures as defined. It is a distinct, leftover form of institutional criticism."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments by depicting them as a coercive, state-backed mechanism that dispossesses citizens (farmers) for corporate gain, but it does not fit the specific definitions of 'abusive international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' as it focuses on domestic exploitation and corporate-state collusion."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups by framing a major climate policy as a massive, secretive corporate handout, but it does not fit neatly into the 'Blaming global elites' or 'Hidden motives' definitions as it focuses on the act itself as a corrupt scheme benefiting corporations."

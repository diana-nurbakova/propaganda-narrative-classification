      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear by presenting a stark choice between submission to Russian demands or facing a 'devastating nuclear strike,' which is a classic fear-amplification tactic."

      "evidence_quote": "She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.” Russian state media and government officials have taken to describing any opponents of the Kremlin in Ukraine as or “Banderites,” the followers of Stepan Bandera... This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses the pejorative label 'Banderites,' equating Ukrainian opponents with ultranationalists/Nazis, which is a standard narrative to discredit Ukraine's government and resistance by associating them with extremism."

      "evidence_quote": "Matveychev noted: “There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes and undermines the United States by portraying it as gullible and easily controlled, which fits the narrative of discrediting Western countries."

      "evidence_quote": "Matveychev became even more brazen: “We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that too costs money and we should get it back. The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote outlines a list of punitive demands (reparations, property seizure) that would constitute severe negative consequences for Western nations, specifically the United States, as a result of their actions."

      "evidence_quote": "Appearing on a state TV show Sunday Evening With Vladimir Soloviev, political scientist and Professor of Communications Dmitry Evstafiev argued: “Right now, President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin’s third proposal to the Ukrainian leadership is on the table. This, of course, is a demonstration of his greatest respect and—I would even say—of love by our President towards the Ukrainian people.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly praises Putin's actions, framing his negotiation stance as an act of 'greatest respect' and 'love,' which glorifies the Russian leader's intentions and character."

For example, the lifting of all sanctions... The dissolution of NATO... Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko... Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko.”",

      "reasoning": "The host's question explicitly and casually raises the possibility of using tactical or strategic nuclear weapons as part of a list of demands, normalizing the threat and amplifying fear."

      "reasoning": "The demand for NATO's dissolution implies a future Russian threat or action against NATO member states, supporting the subnarrative that Russia will attack other countries."

      "reasoning": "The discussion of territorial claims against the United States (Alaska) and other global areas (Antarctic) implies expansionist ambitions and a threat to other nations' sovereignty."

      "evidence_quote": "She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.” Russian state media and government officials have taken to describing any opponents of the Kremlin in Ukraine as or “Banderites,” the followers of Stepan Bandera, the ultranationalist political figure who fought for Ukrainian independence before being assassinated by the KGB in 1959. This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly labels Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites,' a term used to associate them with historical ultranationalist figures and, by extension, Nazi ideology, which aligns with the subnarrative of associating Ukraine with nazism."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly names Ukrainian government officials, including the President, as 'war criminals' to be extradited, which is a clear attempt to delegitimize and discredit the Ukrainian government and its leaders."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by framing the invasion as a 'denazification' mission and discussing plans for public executions, which is a manipulative argument aimed at undermining Ukraine's sovereignty and legitimacy but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarrative definitions."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Multiple state TV shows emphasized the reluctance on the part of the United States and NATO to intervene against Russia’s bloody invasion of its neighbor, presenting it as the proof that the Kremlin can go to any lengths to emerge victorious.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the West (U.S. and NATO) as unwilling to act, portraying them as weak and non-potent in the face of Russian aggression, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as a non-potent group."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the American public is indifferent to Ukraine's fate, suggesting Western support is not genuine or driven by care for Ukraine, but by other interests (or a lack thereof)."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "Olga Skabeeva, the host of a state TV show 60 Minutes, intentionally distorted the statements of White House press secretary Jen Psaki. On Friday, Skabeeva claimed: “Jennifer Psaki’s statement said that no matter what Putin does in Ukraine—whether he uses biological weapons or drops a nuclear bomb—the United States won’t get involved.”",
      "reasoning": "By fabricating a claim that the U.S. stated it wouldn't intervene even against extreme Russian actions, the propagandist implies that Western concerns and threats (like overreacting to potential WMD use) are baseless or that the West's stated red lines are meaningless, which discredits the West's reaction as disproportionate or hollow."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West by portraying the United States as gullible and easily controlled, which undermines its credibility and authority. This specific claim of being 'easily manipulated' does not fit neatly into any of the other provided subnarrative definitions but clearly aims to discredit Western (specifically U.S.) diplomacy and decision-making."

      "evidence_quote": "\"The dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by outlining a catastrophic negative consequence for the West (the dissolution of its primary military alliance) as a demanded outcome of Russia's victory. It does not fit the 'sanctions backfire' or 'refugee flows' definitions."

      "evidence_quote": "“There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "While not direct praise, this quote, in the context of the article describing the use of Tucker Carlson clips, implies a critique of the West and suggests a perception of Russian strategic superiority and influence, indirectly supporting the idea of Russia's position on the international stage. The broader segment discussing anticipated Western concessions also implies a belief in Russia's ability to command international outcomes."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“We can take them down without it.” (in response to a question about using nuclear strikes)",
      "reasoning": "This statement, made by a Kremlin-linked figure on state TV, boasts of Russia's conventional military capability and strategic superiority, suggesting it can achieve its goals without resorting to its ultimate weapons. This supports the parent narrative of praising Russia by highlighting its perceived strength and self-restraint, but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to negotiate with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is being packaged as a sign of his love and good will, and not the consequence of mounting losses and humiliating defeats faced by the Russian military in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly states that the Russian military is facing 'mounting losses and humiliating defeats,' which is a clear suggestion of a significant decline in its effectiveness and strength, matching the definition of the subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "According to top Kremlin propagandists, it’s only a matter of time before the West admits its defeat and pays reparations to Moscow or risks a devastating nuclear strike.",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on the outcome of the war, predicting Western defeat and reparations, which supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes. However, it does not fit the specific definitions about the Russian or Ukrainian army collapsing or losing territories; it is a broader speculative claim about the conflict's resolution."

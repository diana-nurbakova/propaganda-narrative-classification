      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions Russia's invasion as a cause, but also includes 'the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych' as a contributing factor to Ukraine's financial crisis. This fits the narrative of shifting some blame for negative outcomes (economic distress) onto Ukrainian leadership, alongside the primary blame on Russia."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lauds the 'free world' (a term often synonymous with the West) as the champion of democracy fighting against tyranny, framing its victory as a moral triumph. It excessively extols the virtues and moral purpose of the Western-led coalition."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear by graphically predicting potential future Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure in major Western European capitals, suggesting the war could directly spread to the West if Ukraine is not sufficiently supported."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Democracy and a just world order are the pillars of global economic sustainability, ensuring investment safety and security and investor profits worldwide.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that if Ukraine does not prevail (a negative outcome for the West's interests), the foundational pillars of the global economic system (democracy, just world order) will be undermined, leading to widespread negative consequences for investment safety and profits globally, which heavily impacts Western economies."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly attributes the 2015 economic crisis to both the Russian invasion and the policies of a Ukrainian president, thereby shifting partial blame for the situation onto a Ukrainian leader and away from the invader (Russia). It supports the subnarrative by suggesting internal Ukrainian failures contributed to the crisis, which is a form of blaming the war's consequences on others."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Some believe that since Ukraine receives large amounts of international aid, it can be used to settle with bondholders. However, over two-thirds of financial assistance arrives as loans to be redeemed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote addresses and implicitly criticizes a viewpoint that shifts responsibility for debt repayment onto Ukraine by suggesting it should use international aid for creditors. While not directly blaming the West for starting the war, it counters an argument that places financial burdens on Ukraine, which aligns with the broader parent narrative of deflecting blame from the invader by highlighting external pressures and expectations on Ukraine."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames the conflict as a moral battle where the 'free world' (a term synonymous with the West and its allies) is on the side of justice against 'dictators and tyrants,' portraying Western support as morally superior and aligned with a just world order."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support",
      "evidence_quote": "The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine...",
      "reasoning": "This statement emphasizes the 'unity of the free world' and its 'unwavering long-term' support for Ukraine, portraying Western nations as broadly united and committed in their backing, which aligns with the subnarrative of strong international support for Western-aligned actions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This argument overpraises the West by positioning it as the 'civilized world' that needs protection, implying its societies (Amsterdam, Warsaw, Berlin, Prague) are inherently valuable and worth defending, and framing Western support for Ukraine as a direct defense of Western civilization itself, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the other specific definitions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly warns that if Ukraine is not financially supported to resist Russia, the risk of Russian military attacks expanding to other European countries (specifically the Netherlands, Poland, Germany, and the Czech Republic) increases, evoking fear of broader conflict."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that sanctions are a necessary tool to weaken Russia, but the broader context of the article argues that without massive financial support and debt restructuring for Ukraine, the West faces severe negative consequences, indirectly framing sanctions as insufficient and implying that failure to support Ukraine fully will lead to those negative outcomes for the West."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly catastrophizes the potential negative consequences for Western nations (specifically European capitals) if Ukraine is not adequately supported, arguing that failure to ensure Ukraine's victory will lead to direct military attacks on Western soil. This supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West but does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

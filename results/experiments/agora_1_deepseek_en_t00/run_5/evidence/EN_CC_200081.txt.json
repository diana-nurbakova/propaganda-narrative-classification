      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the effectiveness and environmental impact of a specific climate policy (wind farm development) by highlighting a significant negative consequence (tree felling), framing the policy as counterproductive or 'madness'."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland... the leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP)...",
      "reasoning": "The text uses politically charged labels ('leftist', 'separatist') to challenge the competence and motives of the Scottish government, setting a tone of criticism against the authority implementing the climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lists multiple negative environmental and social impacts (deforestation, wildlife harm, problematic mining) associated with wind turbines, expressing clear skepticism and criticism of this green technology."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "The quote connects a green technology (wind turbines) to dependency on a geopolitical rival ('Communist China'), implying that the pursuit of such policies strengthens a foreign power, framing it as a geopolitical instrument rather than a purely environmental solution."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote uses 'supposedly' to cast doubt on the environmental benefit of the wind farms, implying the policy (promoting wind energy) is counterproductive by destroying trees, thus failing to achieve genuine environmental goals."

      "evidence_quote": "“I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'damage to... business' as a concern raised by communities affected by wind farm development, directly linking the climate policy to negative economic outcomes."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes climate policies (wind energy) by highlighting severe environmental and human costs (pollution, health issues) associated with the supply chain in China. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the definitions of 'ineffective', 'negative economic impact', or 'only for profit'."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the actions and policies of the national (devolved) government of Scotland, specifically its handling of environmental and energy policy by prioritizing wind farms over forests."

      "reasoning": "The quote uses politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') to discredit the specific political organization (SNP) and its figure (Mairi Gougeon) in the context of their climate and energy decisions."

Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.",
      "reasoning": "This quote from MSP Liam Kerr criticizes the government's approach by highlighting public distrust and negative impacts on communities and the environment, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing authorities. However, it does not neatly fit the more specific definitions of criticizing the EU, international entities, national governments (already used), or political organizations/figures (already used) as its primary focus is on the policy's consequences and public opposition."

      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that wind turbines cause significant harm, linking them to environmental damage (to wildlife) and severe health consequences for people due to the mining of required minerals, which fits the definition of 'Renewable energy is dangerous'."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "“Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,” adding that the government “must be alive” to the “significant costs” of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'significant costs' associated with wind turbine installation, framing the development as having a high price, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive or inefficient."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the green energy push as hypocritical ('supposedly green') and driven by a specific political ideology ('leftist'), which supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames the green energy supply chain as exploitative, where the environmental and health costs of mining rare earth minerals for Western wind turbines are borne by local communities in China, suggesting a modern form of colonial resource extraction and harm."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a national government's green policy (mass tree felling for wind farms) as hypocritical and damaging, framing the policy as a destructive instrument of domestic governance rather than a genuine environmental benefit, which supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical/instrumental but does not fit the specific 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions."

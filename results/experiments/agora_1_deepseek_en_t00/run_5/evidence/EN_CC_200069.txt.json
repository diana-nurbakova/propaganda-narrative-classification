      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the destruction of 'street zone sectioning barriers' as a form of resistance, implying these barriers are part of a climate policy (like low-traffic neighborhoods) that is being actively opposed and criticized for its impact."
    },

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' directly challenges the validity and rationality of the climate movement, portraying it as an irrational force that requires 'resistance'."

      "reasoning": "Referring to climate change as 'The Climate Con' (a con or fraud) is a direct attempt to downplay its scientific reality and seriousness, framing it as a deceptive scheme rather than a genuine issue."

      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate policies as irrational and misguided, implying they are not a sensible or effective response to climate issues."

      "evidence_quote": "If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "The text labels climate action as 'The Climate Con', a term implying a fraudulent scheme, and directly solicits financial support to fight it, suggesting the policies are driven by deceptive profit motives rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "This describes direct, illegal action against a specific climate policy (traffic filtering/zoning), which criticizes the policy's implementation and social acceptance but does not directly address its effectiveness, economic impact, or profit motive as defined in the other subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'madness' frames the climate change movement and its associated policies as irrational and hysterical, which aligns with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist and exaggerating the issue."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate action as 'The Climate Con' (short for 'con game' or 'confidence trick') directly alleges that the climate movement is a fraudulent scheme, implying it is driven by deception and ulterior motives, which matches the definition of the movement being corrupt."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Taking matters into their own hands, Oxford residents are destroying street zoning barriers. Now that’s quite beautiful to see.",
      "reasoning": "This statement celebrates and encourages direct, illegal action against climate-related policies (street zoning/15-minute city measures). It supports the parent narrative by framing resistance as justified and positive, but this specific argument—endorsing civil disobedience and vandalism as a response—does not fit the definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate change action as irrational or extreme, which is a form of downplaying its seriousness and legitimacy, but does not fit any of the more specific scientific denial subnarratives provided."

      "reasoning": "The text labels climate activists as 'fanatics' and attributes their beliefs to 'propaganda' and a quasi-religious delusion, challenging the movement's motives and integrity."

      "evidence_quote": "even though the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more 'greenhouse gases' like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.",
      "reasoning": "This statement minimizes the significance of human-caused emissions by claiming natural sources are far greater, thereby downplaying the human impact on climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.",
      "reasoning": "The text vividly amplifies fears about the consequences of implementing climate policies, predicting immediate, catastrophic societal collapse and mass death."

      "evidence_quote": "If we “just stop oil” like climate protesters want, six BILLION people could die",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that implementing the climate policy (stopping oil use) would fail to achieve its intended environmental goal of saving the planet and instead lead to catastrophic human death, framing the policy as fundamentally ineffective and counterproductive."

      "evidence_quote": "On the very first day of an oil- and gas-free world... all homes, businesses, and other structures that rely on either or both of these for light, heat, fuel, or what have you would no longer function.",
      "reasoning": "This quote describes a scenario where the cessation of fossil fuel use would cause immediate and total dysfunction of homes and businesses, directly linking the policy to severe negative economic and societal collapse."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by challenging the scientific basis for climate policies, arguing that natural sources are the primary cause of emissions, not human activity. This is a criticism of the policy's rationale but does not fit the definitions of 'ineffective', 'negative economic impact', or 'only for profit'."

      "evidence_quote": "This, they believe, will stop things like 'global warming' and the fear of 'boiling oceans' destroying the planet.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'fear of \"boiling oceans\"' uses hyperbolic and dramatic language to characterize the climate movement's warnings as exaggerated and alarmist."

      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes the climate movement by presenting an extreme, catastrophic consequence of its proposed policy, framing the movement as advocating for a genocidal outcome. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit the definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that natural sources (volcanoes) emit far more greenhouse gases than human activities (cars, cattle), thereby arguing that human activity is not the primary driver of climate change."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by citing an authority figure to claim that the scientific basis for phasing out fossil fuels is lacking. It downplays the urgency and validity of climate action but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about natural cycles, weather, adaptation, etc.)."

      "reasoning": "This quote uses a statement from a COP28 president to claim a lack of scientific backing for a major climate policy, thereby discrediting the scientific basis promoted by the broader climate science community."

      "reasoning": "This statement dismisses the core claims of man-made climate change ('melting or boiling') and directs readers to a source that argues 'this is not the case,' which supports the parent narrative of questioning climate science but does not fit the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "The phrase 'boiling oceans destroying the planet' is a hyperbolic and panic-inducing amplification of the existing scientific concept of ocean warming, used to mock and amplify fears."

      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto Western nations (the UK and US), framing them as the primary obstacle to a peace deal that Russia was supposedly willing to accept."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained... the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers... the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "These statements collectively undermine Ukraine's military effectiveness and strategic position, portraying its efforts as futile and its government as struggling with conscription, which attacks the competence and viability of Ukraine's war effort."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This criticizes Western (and aligned Ukrainian) policy as reckless and counterproductive, suggesting that Western-backed actions are needlessly escalating the conflict rather than pursuing a diplomatic solution."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This statement evokes fear by suggesting that current Western-supported policies are directly increasing the risk of a global nuclear catastrophe, a classic fear-amplifying tactic."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by attributing the prolongation and escalation of the conflict to the actions of Ukraine and its Western backers, rather than to the initial Russian invasion. It is a distinct argument not captured by the specific 'West as aggressors' subnarrative, which focused on the origin of the war, while this focuses on its prolongation."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by highlighting the failure of a major military operation and net territorial loss."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",

      "reasoning": "This statement delegitimizes the Ukrainian government's decision-making, portraying it as incompetent and easily manipulated by foreign powers, leading to a catastrophic war for its people."

      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This claim explicitly frames Ukraine's decision to continue fighting as being directed by Western powers (the UK and US), portraying Ukraine as lacking sovereignty and acting as a puppet."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv... But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This paints a picture of inevitable defeat, emphasizing Ukraine's inability to achieve its military objectives or even maintain its current position, portraying the situation as having no viable positive outcome."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by portraying its government's actions (and those of its allies) as reckless, provocative, and harmful to its own people, which is a distinct argument not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly contrasts Russia's strong military production with the West's comparatively weak output, presenting the West as non-potent and unable to match Russia's war effort."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",

      "reasoning": "This statement claims Western officials (UK and US) persuaded Ukraine to reject a peace deal and continue fighting, implying the West prioritizes its own strategic interests (prolonging the conflict) over Ukraine's welfare and peace."

      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western leadership (Biden, NATO) as delusional and irresponsible, advocating for a diplomatic solution they are allegedly refusing to pursue. It fits the general theme of criticizing Western diplomatic posture but does not align perfectly with the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly warns against continuing a military offensive against Russia, framing it as a dangerous fantasy that could lead to a major, potentially world-scale conflict, and urges a diplomatic solution 'before it's too late', evoking fear of escalation to a world war."

      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by describing a specific, risky escalation of the conflict involving NATO-authorized strikes on Russian territory, which heightens the risk of a broader war. It does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarrative definitions, as it is not solely about WW3, other countries being attacked, nuclear use, or NATO direct intervention, but it clearly amplifies fear of conflict expansion."

      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes and delegitimizes NATO, portraying it not as a defensive alliance but as an aggressive tool for American expansion, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Western institutions and diplomacy."

      "reasoning": "This statement shifts the blame for the war's continuation and enabling away from Russia (the invader) and onto China and the West, suggesting they are responsible for the conflict rather than Russia's initial invasion."

      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's war effort and government by portraying it as callously sacrificing its own citizens, which attacks the legitimacy and actions of the Ukrainian state."

      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear by predicting the expansion of the Ukraine conflict into a global or world war, specifically a 'third one', which is designed to elicit anxiety about severe, widespread consequences."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This statement questions the reliability and integrity of Western mainstream media and official narratives, framing them as 'nonsense' believed only by a select few, thereby undermining confidence in these information sources."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly claims the West is willing to prolong the war in Ukraine for its own strategic ends (expanding to Asia), showing a callous disregard for Ukrainian lives, which are treated as expendable ('just Ukrainian lives after all')."

      "reasoning": "The statement highlights the West's massive military investment and depletion of its own stocks, yet emphasizes the failure to achieve victory ('still not winning'), portraying the West as militarily and strategically ineffective."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying NATO not as a legitimate defensive alliance but as an aggressive, expansionist tool that has outlived its purpose. It fits the broad theme of discrediting Western institutions but does not align precisely with the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, etc.)."

So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the war's continuation and escalation onto the West, framing it as a 'proxy war' they are waging and failing at, while falsely accusing others (China) of enabling it. It absolves the actual invader (Russia) of primary blame."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West for prolonging and expanding the war, and also blames Ukraine's leadership ('Kyiv') for sacrificing its own people. This is a distinct argument that shifts blame away from the invader but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as cleanly, as it combines blame on the West for strategy and on Ukraine for tactics."

      "evidence_quote": "Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly delegitimizes the Ukrainian government's mobilization policies, portraying them as desperate, inhumane, and treating its citizens as expendable, which fits the definition of discrediting the government and its actions."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'proxy war in Ukraine' frames the conflict as one orchestrated and controlled by external Western powers (with Ukraine as the proxy), directly supporting the narrative that Ukraine is not an independent actor but a pawn of the West."

      "reasoning": "This statement portrays the conflict as a protracted, unwinnable war of attrition where Ukrainian lives are being sacrificed pointlessly, implying there is no viable positive outcome or future for Ukraine in this scenario."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by broadly dismissing the Western narrative about Ukraine as 'nonsense' that few believe, which undermines the credibility of Ukraine's international standing and the story told about it. It does not cleanly fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a third world war, framing the conflict's expansion as a deliberate act of globalizing war, which aligns with the subnarrative of warning against actions that risk WW3."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims the conflict is being deliberately expanded from Eastern Europe to Asia, implying an imminent threat of attack or conflict spreading to other regions, matching the subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "Alarmingly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Nato as playing a “bridge” between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific theatres.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests NATO is positioning itself to take direct military action or expand its interventionist role into the Indo-Pacific, implying a shift in strategy towards direct involvement in a broader conflict."

      "reasoning": "This phrase supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by portraying NATO as a barbaric, expansionist force threatening Asia, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., WW3, nuclear weapons, attacking other countries, or NATO intervention). It is a distinct, fear-amplifying argument."

      "evidence_quote": "the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western military support (a form of sanction/coercive action) is depleting their own arsenals without achieving victory, which catastrophizes the negative, self-harming effects of their involvement."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western/American actions are leading to catastrophic global consequences, specifically the risk of a third world war. This is a negative consequence for the West and the world, but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly discredits Western mainstream newsrooms, grouping them with 'corridors of power' and accusing them of being part of a 'dis-information war' that peddles 'nonsense,' which aligns with the definition of portraying Western media as instruments of propaganda."

      "evidence_quote": "Given his obvious mental decline, US President Joe Biden may be forgiven for claiming to ABC News’ host George Stephanopoulos that he was indispensable: “You know, not only am I campaigning, but I’m running the world.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement uses a specific interview with a Western media outlet (ABC News) to mock and discredit a Western leader, implying the media platform is used to propagate delusional or false claims. It supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media but does not fit the specific definitions of targeting 'Western media as an instrument of propaganda' in a general institutional sense or targeting 'Ukrainian media.' It is a distinct, leftover argument that fosters distrust in the information presented by Western media channels."

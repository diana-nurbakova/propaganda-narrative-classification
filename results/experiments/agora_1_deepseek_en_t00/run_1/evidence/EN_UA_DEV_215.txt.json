      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly attacks the character and legitimacy of the Ukrainian state by asserting widespread, pre-existing corruption, which aligns with the narrative of undermining Ukraine's societal and governmental integrity."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western (specifically U.S.) policy and aid efforts by framing them as enabling massive fraud and irresponsible distribution of weapons, thereby discrediting Western diplomatic and military support."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill...",
      "reasoning": "This statement predicts a negative outcome for Western interests—specifically, a reduction in American public support for Ukraine due to revealed corruption—which could undermine the Western strategic position."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly portrays the Ukrainian government and its systems as inherently and historically corrupt, delegitimizing its governance and policies by suggesting aid is being stolen."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities",
      "evidence_quote": "War is a business, and the business of war is going on in Ukraine. The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames Ukraine as a center for illegal war profiteering, massive fraud, and the potential diversion of weapons, aligning with the definition of Ukraine as a hub for criminal activities."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by suggesting its corruption is undermining Western public and financial support, which is a discrediting effect not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western (specifically American) support for Ukraine is driven by self-interest (protecting Europe/NATO from Russia) rather than genuine concern for Ukraine's people or fate, matching the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote claims that revelations of corruption are causing the American public and taxpayers to become less willing to support Ukraine financially, indicating growing fatigue or disinterest, which aligns with the 'West is tired of Ukraine' subnarrative."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "Bulgaria’s only gas oil refinery is owned by Russian Lukoil, and Bulgaria is fully entitled to continue to operate this refinery with Russian oil because it has an exemption from EU sanctions. So, yes, essentially, Ukraine was buying “discounted Russian diesel”, but in a very indirect way and not in the brazen way described by Hersh’s unnamed intelligence source. All of this market activity is accepted by the EU.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a consequence of Western sanctions policy: an EU member state (Bulgaria) is legally allowed to process Russian oil and sell the refined products to Ukraine, meaning Western aid money could indirectly fund Russian interests, suggesting sanctions are not fully effective and have unintended, negative consequences for the West's own goals."

      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly argues that corruption in Ukraine (a theme of the text) will lead to a negative consequence for the West: a reduction in American public and taxpayer support for funding Ukraine's defense, thereby weakening Western resolve and strategic objectives. This fits the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West but does not align with the specific 'sanctions backfire' or 'refugee flows' subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly questions the reliability and motives of Western media, accusing it of misleading framing that has negative consequences, which fits the 'Distrust towards Media' narrative."

      "evidence_quote": "Russia is Winning, Nuclear Threat is a Sign of Desperation & Very Serious",
      "reasoning": "The title of the post makes a definitive prediction about who is winning the war ('Russia is Winning') and speculates on the meaning and seriousness of the nuclear threat, which directly aligns with the narrative of speculating on war outcomes."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death. The question is, why the desperation to keep the war going?",
      "reasoning": "This implies that the West, through its media, is deliberately prolonging the war in Ukraine for its own reasons (e.g., to weaken Russia), showing a disregard for Ukrainian lives and peace, which fits the subnarrative of the West being self-interested."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "Scott Ritter ..good topics ..talking the truth..yes but where is what he says getting us …seems nowhere",

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "I do not think an amerikan life is worth 1/2 as much as an African (or any other life outside the west) ..they are trash ..not worth the effort ..get to a point of “kill them all” either because they do not care and they want us all dead ..or because they just sit back and “DO NOT CARE”",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West by portraying Western (specifically American) populations as morally bankrupt, uncaring, and deserving of destruction. It is a broad, vitriolic condemnation that fits the parent narrative but does not align with any of the more specific diplomatic subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "Another must listen to interview with information that you are missing from the corporation propaganda western media",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly labels Western media as 'corporation propaganda,' framing it as a tool that withholds truthful information and serves a propagandistic function, which aligns with the definition of discrediting Western media institutions as instruments of propaganda."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by accusing Western media of a specific, harmful misrepresentation (framing Russia as losing) that has dire consequences (prolonging war and death). It discredits Western media's reporting but does not fit the more specific definitions of being an 'instrument of propaganda' or targeting Ukrainian media; it is a distinct argument about the media's role in prolonging conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by presenting a nihilistic, despairing acceptance of total nuclear annihilation, which supports the parent narrative of amplifying fears but does not fit the specific definitions of warning about WW3, attacks on other countries, or NATO intervention."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "for the west it’s always been the soviet (RUSSIAN) that has ALWAYS been the boogie man..when in fact they were SELDOM a threat.. amerika always blew any comment about RUSSIA or at later stages CHINA way out of proportion.. and you are still doing",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that Western (specifically American) demonization and overreaction to Russia is a persistent, misguided policy. It implies that this aggressive posture, which includes sanctions and confrontation, is based on a false premise ('SELDOM a threat') and is therefore a self-inflicted negative consequence for the West, aligning with the idea that Western actions will backfire."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly and no more of month after month of promises from Trump or threats from the east….POOF..it’s all over …thanks mostly to un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries” they are proving the worst of the worst of humanity",
      "reasoning": "This quote presents a catastrophic, nihilistic vision of a nuclear war triggered by the conflict, blaming 'un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries”'. It supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West by portraying Western political systems as leading to apocalyptic outcomes, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific subnarratives about sanctions or refugee flows."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia is Winning",
      "reasoning": "The title directly states 'Russia is Winning,' which implies the opposing force, the Ukrainian army, is losing or collapsing in effectiveness, aligning with the subnarrative definition of claiming a significant decline in the Ukrainian military's position."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death. The question is, why the desperation to keep the war going? Will they resort to nuclear weapons to even out the war?",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on the potential future actions (resorting to nuclear weapons) and motivations (desperation) of a party in the conflict, which fits the parent narrative of speculating on war outcomes but does not align with the specific definitions about army collapse or loss of territory."

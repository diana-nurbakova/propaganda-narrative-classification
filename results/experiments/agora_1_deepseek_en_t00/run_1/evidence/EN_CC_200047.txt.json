      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policies as 'tyrannical,' directly questioning their legitimacy and motives, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing the effectiveness and underlying intentions of climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "According to a report from the Committee to Unleash Prosperity (CUP), America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote challenges the integrity and intentions of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and wealthy elites, suggesting their support for rationing is not genuine environmental concern but an imposition on the public."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The text presents a narrative where a powerful group ('American elites') is conspiring with a global institution (WEF) to impose restrictive policies ('ration meat, gas, electricity') on the general public, fitting the theme of hidden plots by powerful groups."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "The report includes polling data regarding support for policies designed to force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda' frames environmental policy (Net Zero) as a tool for a powerful international organization (WEF) to exert control, aligning with the narrative that green policies are instruments of geopolitical power."

      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The use of scare quotes around 'climate' and the descriptor 'tyrannical' frames the policies as illegitimate and not genuinely aimed at solving an environmental problem, suggesting they are ineffective in their stated purpose."

      "reasoning": "The text frames climate policies (rationing of essential goods like gas, electricity, and food) as direct restrictions on public consumption and quality of life, which implies negative economic and lifestyle impacts on the general population."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The report includes polling data regarding support for policies designed to force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'force compliance' and the association with the WEF's agenda implies the policies are a top-down imposition by a powerful, elite group, suggesting the agenda serves the interests of that group rather than the public good."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the proponents of climate policies by attacking their character and worldview (as being anti-liberty), which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, by labeling its climate policies as 'tyrannical,' which aligns with the definition of disapproving of the role and influence of international entities on climate policy."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Astonishingly, the polling shows that almost 90 percent of “American elites” believe strict rationing of gas, meat, and electricity is necessary to combat the so-called “climate crisis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes 'American elites,' a group that includes political figures and organizations, by portraying their beliefs as extreme and out of touch, which discredits them in the context of the climate change debate."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the attitudes of elites (an institutional/authoritative group) regarding liberty, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities. However, it does not fit the specific definitions of criticizing the EU, international entities, national governments, or political organizations/figures in the context of climate policy, as it is a broader criticism of their worldview."

      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes the push for restrictive climate policies to a specific, powerful global elite group (the WEF) and a domestic elite class that supports it, framing them as a secretive, tyrannical force."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives",
      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The use of 'allegedly' casts doubt on the stated motive of fighting climate change, implying the rationing plan is driven by an ulterior motive, such as controlling the public's quality of life or exerting power, rather than a genuine environmental concern."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The poll, released this month and titled “Them vs. U.S.: The two Americas and how the nation’s elite is out of touch with average Americans,” was billed by the committee as a “first-of-its-kind look at the views of the American Elite.”",
      "reasoning": "This framing of 'Them vs. U.S.' and the detailed definition of the 'American Elite' as a distinct, out-of-touch class supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups by constructing a clear 'us vs. them' dichotomy where a secretive, educated, wealthy elite is plotting policies against the general public. This specific argument about a domestic elite class being out of touch and driving the agenda is not fully captured by the other two subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the WEF's climate agenda as a plan for the wealthy elite to impose restrictive policies (rationing) on the general public, characterizing the international climate policy framework as exploitative and abusive towards ordinary citizens."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by portraying international green policies (WEF's agenda) as a tyrannical instrument, but it does not specifically describe them as exploitative in international relations or as neo-colonialism. It is a distinct argument about elite-driven tyranny, which is a remainder not captured by the specific subnarratives."

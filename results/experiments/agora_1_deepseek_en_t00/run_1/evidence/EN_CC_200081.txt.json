      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the effectiveness and environmental impact of a specific climate policy (wind farm development), framing it as contradictory ('green madness') and highlighting a negative consequence (tree felling)."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lists multiple criticisms of wind turbines (ecological damage, reliance on problematic supply chains), expressing skepticism about the technology's overall environmental and social benefits."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "The text links green technology (wind turbines) to dependency on a geopolitical rival ('Communist China'), suggesting environmental policies create strategic vulnerabilities rather than being purely for environmental good."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland... the leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP)...",
      "reasoning": "The repeated use of politically charged labels ('leftist', 'separatist') challenges the legitimacy and motives of the governing institution implementing the climate policies."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the wind farm policy as environmentally counterproductive by highlighting the destruction of a large number of trees, which are natural carbon sinks, to build 'green' infrastructure. This suggests the policy fails to achieve its intended environmental goals, as it causes significant ecological harm."

      "evidence_quote": "“I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'damage to... business' as a concern raised by rural communities regarding wind farm developments, directly linking the climate policy to negative economic outcomes for local enterprises."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes climate policies (specifically wind energy) by linking them to severe human rights and environmental abuses in foreign countries (China). This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the definitions of being ineffective, economically harmful, or profit-driven. It is a distinct, leftover argument."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that the production of wind turbines relies on a process (mining rare earth minerals) that causes severe health and environmental damage, framing renewable energy as dangerous to human health and ecosystems."

      "evidence_quote": "responding to the letter, Mr Kerr said: “Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,” adding that the government “must be alive” to the “significant costs” of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions the 'significant costs' associated with wind turbine installation, framing the development as having a high, perhaps hidden, price that the public should be aware of, aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the pursuit of 'green energy' (wind farms) as hypocritical and environmentally destructive due to the large-scale deforestation required, which is a criticism of green technology but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy. It supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies through the argument of negative environmental trade-offs."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the supply chain for 'green' wind turbines as reliant on exploitative mining practices in China, causing severe local harm. It suggests that the pursuit of green energy in the West (Scotland) is built upon environmental and human exploitation in a developing region, which aligns with the definition of green initiatives as a modern form of colonial control and abuse."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a national green policy (wind farm development) as hypocritical and destructive, framing it as a geopolitical instrument used by a specific government ('leftist Scottish Govt') to pursue an agenda that is counterproductive and damaging domestically. It supports the parent narrative that green policies are tools for political/geopolitical ends, but the specific argument about domestic environmental hypocrisy and government action does not fit the 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions."

      "reasoning": "The quote uses politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') to discredit the SNP government and its specific figure, Mairi Gougeon, in the context of their climate-related policies."

      "evidence_quote": "I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business. Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.",
      "reasoning": "This quote from MSP Liam Kerr criticizes the government's approach by highlighting public opposition and negative impacts, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing authorities, but the specific criticism is about policy implementation and community impact, not fitting neatly into the other defined subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Nevertheless, the Scottish government has vowed to continue its “green energy” push, with a Forestry and Land Scotland spokesman saying: “Renewable energy generated from wind farms is a key element in Scotland’s response to the climate emergency and the shift towards net zero and the infrastructure on land that we manage generates enough power for 600,000 homes.”",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate emergency' is placed in scare quotes, and the article's framing of the government's vow as 'Nevertheless' following a litany of negative impacts suggests the 'green energy' push is based on exaggerated or alarmist premises, which is a criticism of the climate movement's foundational rhetoric."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The use of 'supposedly' and the description of the government as 'leftist' and 'separatist' frames the 'green energy' agenda as a deceptive or corrupt enterprise, prioritizing ideological or political goals over genuine environmentalism, which aligns with the subnarrative of the movement being corrupt or driven by ulterior motives."

      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes the climate movement's proposed solutions (wind turbines) by highlighting severe negative environmental and human costs (deforestation, wildlife harm, toxic mining in China) that contradict the movement's stated goals. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

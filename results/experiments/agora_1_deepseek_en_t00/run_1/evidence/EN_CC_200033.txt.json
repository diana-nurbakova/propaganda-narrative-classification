      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism. Run your eye down the contributors to The Climate Book and you can see who she’s been reading: Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Naomi Klein. For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Greta Thunberg and her associated thinkers as having a hidden, radical political agenda (anti-capitalism, de-growth) that subverts the stated goal of addressing climate change, thereby challenging the motives and integrity of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly claims that the climate movement's true goal is not environmental protection but the geopolitical and ideological destruction of Western civilization, framing green policies as a tool for this purpose."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the offshoot of which, Just Stop Oil, is currently engaged in blocking roads across London, admitted in his own words that his movement “isn’t about the climate.”",
      "reasoning": "The text suggests that the climate movement, represented by Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil, is a front for a hidden, radical political plot (to tear down Western capitalism) that its leaders have secretly admitted to."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'human alarm bell' and 'climate Cassandra' directly frames Greta Thunberg and, by extension, the climate movement she represents, as figures defined by alarmism and exaggerated warnings."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto.",
      "reasoning": "The word 'demented' is a direct personal attack on Greta Thunberg's mental state and the substance of her advocacy, attacking her reputation rather than her arguments."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "Labeling a major international climate conference (COP) as a 'scam' that facilitates dishonesty and deception implies the broader climate movement and its institutional efforts are corrupt and operate with unethical motives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement by alleging its true, hidden goal is not environmental protection but the advancement of a radical left-wing political ideology. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "“Normal” was the “system” which gave us the climate crisis, a system of “colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide”, of “racist, oppressive extractionism”.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the climate crisis and the system causing it in terms of colonialism and imperialism, suggesting that green activism is a response to and a critique of a system seen as a modern form of colonial exploitation."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes a major international climate institution (COP) as fundamentally dishonest and exploitative, supporting the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments, but it does not fit the specific definitions of 'abusive/exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' as cleanly."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that the stated goal of the climate agenda is a cover for a different, radical political motive, aligning with the definition of the climate action push being driven by ulterior motives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the offshoot of which, Just Stop Oil, is currently engaged in blocking roads across London, admitted in his own words that his movement 'isn’t about the climate.'",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by suggesting a prominent climate movement is secretly about something else, but the specific motive described (tearing down western capitalism) is more about a broad ideological overthrow than a secret scheme by a powerful elite group, fitting the 'Other' category."

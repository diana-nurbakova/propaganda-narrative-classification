      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the US as having a primary, materialistic motive for the conflict (access to minerals), thereby shifting the narrative away from Russia's responsibility for starting the war and suggesting the West is fighting for resources, not principles like sovereignty."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Graham is treating Ukraine as a future colony of the US with his comments on the ownership of the country's natural resources... 'The fate of the colonies is always the same: the Americans will scoop up all the natural resources of Ukraine in exchange for 'the great honor of being a friend of the United States''",
      "reasoning": "The text, through the Russian official's statement, directly criticizes and discredits Western (specifically US) intentions, portraying them as colonialist and exploitative rather than supportive, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy and motives."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the legitimacy and character of the Ukrainian government by labeling it as both 'corrupt' and a 'neo-Nazi regime', which is a classic discrediting narrative aimed at undermining Ukraine's leadership."

      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the US/West's motivation for involvement in the war as economic exploitation and resource acquisition, shifting the cause of the conflict from Russian invasion to Western greed and aggression."

      "evidence_quote": "Graham is treating Ukraine as a future colony of the US with his comments on the ownership of the country's natural resources, said Vladimir Dzhabarov, official of the Russian Federation Council.",
      "reasoning": "This statement, attributed to a Russian official, explicitly characterizes the West (specifically the US) as a colonial aggressor seeking to subjugate Ukraine for its resources, thereby blaming the West for the conflict's dynamics."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by blaming the continuation of the war on a corrupt Ukrainian leadership propped up by the West, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' subnarratives. It shifts blame to a third party (the 'neo-Nazi regime') enabled by the West."

      "evidence_quote": "“They’re sitting on 10 to $12 trillion of critical minerals in Ukraine. They could be the richest country in all of Europe,\" Graham said. \"If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames Western support for Ukraine as motivated by access to valuable mineral resources, suggesting the West's primary interest is economic gain rather than Ukraine's sovereignty or welfare."

While \"promising Ukrainians mountains of gold, Graham in fact considers it as a future American colony,\" Dzhabarov said.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying the US as having colonial/imperialist ambitions in Ukraine, which is a distinct theme not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement delegitimizes the Ukrainian government by labeling it as both 'corrupt' and a 'neo-Nazi regime', which are classic tropes used to portray it as illegitimate and morally reprehensible."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'neo-Nazi regime in Kiev' directly accuses the Ukrainian government of being ideologically aligned with Nazism, which is a core element of this subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by reducing the Western motive for supporting Ukraine to pure resource extraction and geopolitical greed, which undermines Ukraine's agency and the legitimacy of its cause. This specific argument—that the conflict is solely about resource plunder—does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

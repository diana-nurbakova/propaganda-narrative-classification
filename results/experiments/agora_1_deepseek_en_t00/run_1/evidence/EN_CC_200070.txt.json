      "evidence_quote": "though L.A.’s infrastructure is not widely considered “high-quality.” A proposed high-speed rail between L.A. and San Francisco has been largely canceled, and current passenger rail service from L.A. to San Diego has been suspended...",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the competence and effectiveness of the mayor and his administration in delivering on climate and infrastructure promises, undermining their authority and credibility."

      "reasoning": "This statement highlights opposition and electoral failure for a key climate policy, framing the climate movement's initiatives as unpopular and politically untenable, thus challenging its impact and support."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific climate policy (the Green New Deal) by highlighting its political opposition and electoral failure, suggesting it is not achieving its intended goals."

      "reasoning": "The quote frames the mayor's trip as hypocritical and wasteful, implying the summit is more about political posturing and international travel than genuine environmental action, aligning with the idea that such policies/events serve interests other than the climate."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes climate policy engagement by contrasting it with domestic failures (crime, homelessness, political crisis), arguing that the focus on climate comes at the expense of addressing more immediate, pressing local issues. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Mayor Eric Garcetti's performance and legacy, focusing on domestic failures (crime, homelessness) and a political crisis within his party, thereby discrediting him as a political figure in the context of his climate-related activities."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",

      "reasoning": "This statement implicitly criticizes the decision-making and priorities of the summit organizers (an institutional body) by questioning the necessity of in-person attendance, which supports the broader narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit a more specific subcategory like criticism of the EU, international entities, or national governments."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the practical choices and logic of the climate movement's activities, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing the movement, but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks. It represents a general critique of inefficiency or lack of common sense."

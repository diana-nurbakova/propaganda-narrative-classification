    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames a climate-related policy proposal (reducing laundry frequency) as an infringement on fundamental rights, questioning its rationale and impact on personal freedom, which aligns with criticizing the effectiveness and motives behind climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the World Economic Forum (WEF), accusing it of hypocrisy and of designing policies that unfairly target ordinary citizens while protecting elites."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "The text portrays the WEF's actions as part of a deliberate scheme by a powerful globalist elite (led by Klaus Schwab) to use environmental policy as a tool to control and oppress ordinary citizens, which fits the narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "By highlighting Schwab's praise for China and the gathering of global elites at 'Summer Davos,' the text implies that environmental and economic policies promoted by forums like the WEF are tools for building geopolitical alliances and consolidating power among a select group of nations and elites, rather than being purely for environmental benefit."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote contrasts the proposed policy (restricting laundry) with the massive carbon footprint of the elites promoting it, implying the policy is an ineffective and hypocritical approach to addressing climate change, as it targets minor citizen behaviors while ignoring major polluters."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly argues that climate policies are designed to protect the financial and privileged status of elites ('billionaires and elites') while imposing burdens on ordinary citizens, framing the policies as a tool for maintaining power and profit rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by framing them as an extreme, rights-stripping overreach that infringes on personal dignity and fundamental freedoms, a theme not fully captured by the more specific economic or profit-driven subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The text directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and ordering governments to limit citizens' consumption, framing its actions as an overreach of authority in the context of climate policy."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes specific political figures ('globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians') and the political organization (the WEF/Davos) for hypocrisy, accusing them of excessive personal carbon emissions while advocating for restrictive policies on the public."

      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities (the WEF) but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives. It accuses the WEF of protecting elite privileges while designing environmental policies that unfairly target and disenfranchise ordinary citizens, which is a broader criticism of its motives and governance."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims the climate agenda (promoted by the WEF) is not about the environment but is a tool for a hidden motive: to protect elite privileges while stripping rights from ordinary citizens, framing climate action as a means for social control and power consolidation."

The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of secretive powerful groups (WEF) orchestrating hidden plots (issuing orders/guidelines to governments to restrict public behavior), but its specific focus on controlling personal consumption and hygiene does not neatly fit the definitions of 'Blaming global elites' or 'Climate agenda has hidden motives' as the primary thrust. It is a distinct, supporting argument about secretive control."

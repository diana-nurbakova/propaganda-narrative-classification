      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto Western nations (the UK and US), framing them as the primary obstacle to a peace deal that Russia was supposedly willing to accept."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained... the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers... the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "These statements collectively undermine Ukraine's military effectiveness and strategic position, portraying its efforts as futile and its government as struggling with conscription, which attacks the competence and viability of Ukraine's war effort."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Western (and Ukrainian) policy as reckless and counterproductive, directly discrediting the diplomatic and military strategy of the West and its allies."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear by suggesting that current Western-supported actions are leading the world toward a catastrophic nuclear event, which is a classic fear-amplifying narrative."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv... Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "These are definitive predictions about Ukraine's inevitable military failure and inability to achieve its goals, which fits the narrative of speculating on negative war outcomes for Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by attributing the prolongation and escalation of the conflict to the decisions of Ukraine and its Western allies, rather than to Russia's initial and ongoing invasion. It is a distinct argument not captured by the specific 'West are the aggressors' subnarrative, which focuses on causing the war, as this focuses on prolonging it."

      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by stating their major offensive failed and resulted in net territorial losses."

      "evidence_quote": "What makes Ukraine’s situation even more tragic is how easily it could have been avoided.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by framing its current suffering as the result of its own (or its backers') avoidable mistakes, which is a general discrediting argument not captured by the more specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly compares Western and Russian military production, presenting the West as incapable of matching Russia's output, thereby depicting the West as weak and non-potent in its support for Ukraine."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims that Western powers (UK and US) persuaded Ukraine to reject a peace deal, prioritizing a continued conflict that serves Western strategic interests over a resolution that would have spared Ukrainian lives and territory."

      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "This concluding statement frames current Western policy as a fantasy of military victory, implicitly discrediting ongoing diplomatic efforts and suggesting that a shift to genuine negotiation is the only realistic solution, thereby casting doubt on the efficacy of current diplomacy."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by accusing the West (and Ukraine's government) of recklessly escalating the conflict for no strategic gain, which is a criticism of Western diplomatic and military strategy that does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions."

      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly warns against continuing a military offensive against Russia, framing it as a dangerous fantasy that could lead to a major escalation, implicitly evoking the fear of a world war if diplomacy is not pursued."

      "reasoning": "The statement explicitly claims that the described escalatory actions (strikes on Russian nuclear early-warning radars, US missile tests, Russian nuclear drills) are moving the world toward a catastrophic nuclear event, directly evoking fear about the use of nuclear weapons."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden then renewed one of his favorite tropes, asserting that if Ukraine falls, its people will be subjugated, its neighbors will be in immediate danger, and all of Europe will be threatened by Putin’s aggressive ambitions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, while presented critically by the author, amplifies war-related fears by describing a domino effect of danger and subjugation across Europe if Ukraine falls. It supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears but does not fit the specific definitions of WWIII, Russia attacking other countries, nuclear weapons, or NATO intervention as defined."

      "evidence_quote": "At the same time, the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers that no amount of foreign aid or equipment transfers can do anything to alleviate... As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly describes a significant decline in the Ukrainian military's manpower and effectiveness, suggesting it is collapsing due to a lack of personnel and aging forces."

      "reasoning": "This statement speculates on a potential war outcome, explicitly stating that Ukraine lacks the capability to drive Russian forces out of all occupied territories, implying that Russia will not lose them."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But the West’s chosen depiction of Putin as a tyrant bent on conquering the entire European continent suffered its latest setback last month when it came out that the Russian president is interested in halting the fighting and negotiating a deal that recognizes the current battlefield lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on a potential war outcome—a negotiated settlement based on current lines—which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of Russian or Ukrainian collapse or the loss of all occupied territories."

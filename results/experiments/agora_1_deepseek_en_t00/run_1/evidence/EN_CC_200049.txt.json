      "reasoning": "The text uses selective data from an official agency (EPA) to cast doubt on the scientific claim that heat is the leading weather-related killer, thereby questioning the evidence base used to support climate change concerns."

      "reasoning": "This quote presents an argument that global warming has a net positive effect by significantly reducing cold-related deaths, which outweighs a slight increase in heat-related deaths, framing climate change as having beneficial outcomes."

      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the net mortality impact of climate change is minimal or even beneficial, as the slight increase in heat deaths is offset by a larger decrease in cold deaths, thereby downplaying the significant negative impact of rising temperatures."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges a specific claim made by climate advocates (about heat being the leading cause of weather-related deaths) to undermine the perceived urgency and severity of climate change impacts. It supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change but does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote uses data to downplay the impact of global warming, suggesting the net effect on mortality is beneficial (cold deaths decreasing more than heat deaths increase), which implicitly questions the severity or even the existence of harmful temperature increases as claimed."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly argues that a warming climate reduces cold-related mortality at a rate more than double the increase in heat-related mortality, framing the net effect of rising temperatures as beneficial to human health by saving more lives from cold than it costs from heat."

      "reasoning": "This evidence supports the overarching narrative that climate change is beneficial by challenging the premise that heat is the primary weather-related killer, thereby downplaying a major negative consequence of warming. It is a distinct argument not captured by the specific 'CO2 is beneficial' or 'Temperature increase is beneficial' subnarratives, as it focuses on comparative mortality statistics to suggest the current climate situation is less dangerous than claimed."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes a factual claim made by the climate movement (represented by Science Alert), arguing it is factually incorrect. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.' It is a substantive critique of their messaging."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage during Sweden’s Strictly Come Dancing final over the weekend.",
      "reasoning": "The terms 'radical climate activist' and the description of the activists' disruptive, staged protest ('stormed the stage') frames the climate movement in a negative, extremist light, challenging its integrity and methods."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, attributed to the activist group, directly emphasizes catastrophic and existential fears about climate change, aligning with the narrative of amplifying climate fears."
    }

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Watch: Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane After Storming Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The term 'Eco-Loon' is a derogatory and dismissive label attacking the character and sanity of the activists, fitting the definition of an ad hominem attack on key figures in the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the activists' actions as criminal (vandalism) and disruptive, which criticizes the movement's methods and supports the parent narrative, but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This direct quote from the activist group presents an intense catastrophic scenario for humanity as a result of climate change, framing it as a global threat leading to societal collapse."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The activists' statement uses the disruption of a popular entertainment event to amplify climate fears, justifying extreme action by invoking a catastrophic threat. This supports the parent narrative of amplifying climate fears but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about uninhabitability, warming fears, or futility."

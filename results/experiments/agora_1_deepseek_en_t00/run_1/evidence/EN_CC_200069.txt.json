      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the destruction of 'street zone sectioning barriers' as a form of resistance, implying these barriers are part of a climate policy (like low-traffic neighborhoods) that is being actively opposed and criticized for its impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' directly challenges the rationale and actions of the climate movement, portraying it as irrational and something that necessitates 'resistance'."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate change as 'The Climate Con' (a con or fraud) fundamentally downplays its scientific reality and seriousness, framing it as a deceptive scheme rather than a genuine issue."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The act of residents destroying the barriers suggests they view the policy (street zoning/sectioning, implied to be a climate policy) as illegitimate and not achieving its goal, indicating a belief in its ineffectiveness or failure."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate policies as irrational and extreme, which is a criticism of the policies themselves but does not fit the specific definitions of being ineffective, economically harmful, or profit-driven."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'madness' frames the climate change movement and its policies as irrational and hysterical, which aligns with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist and exaggerating the issue."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023. If you want to support the fight against The Climate Con, paid members get access to the 2nd part of The Climate Con Podcast.",
      "reasoning": "Referring to climate action as 'The Climate Con' directly alleges it is a fraudulent scheme or scam, implying corruption and ulterior motives behind the movement."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Taking matters into their own hands, Oxford residents are destroying street zoning barriers. Now that’s quite beautiful to see.",
      "reasoning": "This celebrates direct, illegal action against climate-related policies (street zoning/15-minute city concepts). It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement by endorsing civil disobedience against its implementations, which is not captured by the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' frames climate change action as irrational or extreme, which is a form of downplaying its seriousness and legitimacy, but does not fit any of the more specific scientific or impact-denial subnarratives provided."

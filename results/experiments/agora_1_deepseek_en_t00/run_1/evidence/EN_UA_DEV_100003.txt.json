      "evidence_quote": "\"Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote is a direct prediction and assumption about the potential future results of the conflict, specifically stating that the Russian military advance will likely reach the Ukrainian capital."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement positively highlights Russia's territorial claims and actions by glorifying the annexation of Odesa, framing it as a rightful return of a historically and culturally Russian city, which is a form of praise for Russia's expansionist policy."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "On the eve of its second anniversary, Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's, and a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests a decline in Ukrainian military effectiveness and strength by stating they are 'outnumbered and outgunned' and facing a critical shortage of aid, which supports the subnarrative of the Ukrainian army collapsing."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian troops will go much further into Ukraine, taking the southern city of Odesa and might even one day push on to the capital Kyiv, a senior ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on future war outcomes (Russian advances to Odesa and Kyiv) but does not fit the specific definitions of 'Russian army is collapsing', 'Russian army will lose all occupied territories', or 'Ukrainian army is collapsing'. It is a distinct speculative statement about Russian gains, supporting the parent narrative but requiring the 'Other' category."

      "evidence_quote": "On the eve of its second anniversary, Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly highlights Russia's superior military scale and firepower compared to Ukraine, which aligns with the definition of praising Russian military might."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,\" Medvedev said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Russia's territorial ambitions as a benevolent 'homecoming' for Odesa, portraying Russian control as a natural and positive outcome for the city and its people, aligning with the narrative of Russia providing peace and prosperity to those it incorporates."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia's strategic position and morale positively, but it does not fit neatly into any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about military might, Putin, international support, or domestic support). It is a distinct, positive portrayal of Russia's confidence."

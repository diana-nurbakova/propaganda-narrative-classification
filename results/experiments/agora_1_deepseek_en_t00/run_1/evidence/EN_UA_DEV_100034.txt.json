    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions Russia's invasion as a cause, but also introduces 'the poor policies' of a former Ukrainian president as a contributing factor to Ukraine's financial crisis, which subtly shifts some blame for the situation onto Ukrainian leadership alongside the invader."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lauds the 'free world' (a term often synonymous with Western democracies) as the force for good fighting against tyranny, framing the conflict in morally superior terms and excessively praising the collective West's role and virtue."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear by graphically predicting potential Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure in major Western European capitals, suggesting the war will directly threaten the West if Ukraine is not supported."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The statement highlights a predicted adverse outcome (destruction of hospitals in Western capitals) for Western countries, framing it as a consequence of insufficient support for Ukraine, thereby underscoring negative impacts on the West."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly attributes the 2015 crisis to both Russia's invasion and the policies of a former Ukrainian president, but by including Yanukovych's 'poor policies' as a primary cause alongside the invasion, it shifts a portion of the blame for Ukraine's financial and defensive weakness onto internal Ukrainian leadership, indirectly supporting the narrative that Ukraine's own actions contributed to the conflict's escalation and consequences."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, while calling for action against Russia, frames the conflict as one where the 'civilized world' has a responsibility to act. This implicitly supports the parent narrative by suggesting that the continuation and outcome of the war depend on the actions of external parties (the West), rather than being solely the responsibility of the primary invader. It places a conditional burden on the West for Ukraine's victory."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames the conflict as a moral battle where the 'free world' (a term synonymous with the West) is on the side of justice against 'dictators and tyrants', portraying Western support as morally superior and aligned with a just cause."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support",
      "evidence_quote": "The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine...",
      "reasoning": "This statement emphasizes the 'unity of the free world' and its 'unwavering long-term' support for Ukraine, portraying Western nations as broadly united and committed in their backing, which aligns with the subnarrative of strong international support for Western-aligned actions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This passage overpraises the West by portraying it as the 'civilized world' that needs protection, implicitly contrasting it with a barbaric aggressor. It frames Western support for Ukraine as a defensive shield for Western cities, elevating the West's role and moral imperative in the conflict beyond the specific definitions of the other subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly warns that if Ukraine does not prevail, the Russian military threat will extend to other European countries, specifically naming cities in NATO member states, which matches the definition of evoking fear of imminent attacks on other countries."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that Western sanctions and asset confiscation are necessary to weaken Russia, but the broader context of the article argues that without massive financial support and debt restructuring for Ukraine, the West faces severe negative consequences, framing sanctions as part of a costly but essential effort to avoid worse outcomes."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly catastrophizes the potential negative consequences for the West (specifically European capitals) if Ukraine is not adequately supported, implying that failure to assist Ukraine financially will lead to direct military attacks on Western civilian infrastructure."

      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of living (housing, fuel, utilities) to 'green' policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."

      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly challenges the competence and impact of the Biden administration's policies, framing them as harmful to Americans, which fits the narrative of criticizing institutions and authorities in relation to climate change."

These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses strong skepticism and criticism of wind, solar, and biomass technologies, labeling them as inefficient, expensive, environmentally destructive, and incapable of meeting energy demands, which directly fits the 'Controversy about green technologies' narrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of housing, fuel, and utilities to climate policies, arguing they negatively impact the economy by making essential goods and services unaffordable."

      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the promoted renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are environmentally destructive and incapable of meeting energy demands, thereby claiming the policy approach is ineffective at solving the energy or climate problem."

      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' criticizes the overarching ideological approach of authorities/institutions, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing institutions. However, it does not neatly fit the more specific definitions targeting the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures alone, as it implies a broader, ideologically driven critique."

      "evidence_quote": "\"These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance\"",
      "reasoning": "This claim characterizes renewable energy infrastructure as environmentally destructive and resource-intensive, framing it as posing significant risks or dangers to the environment, which fits the subnarrative definition."

      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies by linking them to broad socio-economic harms (unaffordable housing, high costs of living) that are not captured by the specific subnarratives about energy's danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy."

      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' frames the policies not as domestic environmental measures but as part of a broader, internationally-driven agenda, supporting the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments. This specific phrasing does not fit the 'neo-colonialism' or 'abusive relations' definitions but clearly supports the overarching idea."

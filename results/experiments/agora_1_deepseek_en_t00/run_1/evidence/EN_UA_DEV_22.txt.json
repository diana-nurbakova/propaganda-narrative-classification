      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia, the invader, and onto the West, accusing it of vetoing a peace agreement."

      "reasoning": "The statement criticizes Western (EU) policy, portraying it as a malicious proxy war driven by American interests that harms Europe and Ukraine, thereby discrediting Western diplomatic and military actions."

      "reasoning": "This quote predicts a severe, violent negative consequence (the leveling of Western Europe) for the West if it continues its current policy of supporting Ukraine, aiming to deter that support."

      "reasoning": "The statement explicitly evokes fear of a catastrophic, large-scale war spreading to and destroying Western Europe, which is a core tactic of amplifying war-related fears."

      "evidence_quote": "He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a “US problem.”",

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others (by framing Western support as the cause of Slavic deaths) but does not fit the specific definitions of blaming Ukraine or the West as the aggressor. It introduces a distinct ethno-nationalist argument not covered by the other subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims that Western support is not driven by genuine concern for Ukraine but by the self-serving interests of the military-industrial complex, disregarding Ukraine's fate."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western support has negative consequences (wasting taxpayer money, fueling a destructive war that doesn't serve European interests), but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows. It is a distinct argument about economic waste and strategic harm."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a catastrophic escalation, suggesting that continued Western support for Ukraine will provoke a unified Slavic (implicitly Russian-led) retaliation that would destroy Western Europe, which is a clear warning against upsetting Russia and its sphere, aligning with the fear of causing a wider, world-altering conflict."

The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by framing Western support not as aid but as a cynical, profit-driven prolongation of a conflict that could have ended, thereby fostering anxiety and resentment about the continuation and purpose of the war. It supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of nuclear use, NATO intervention, or attacks on other countries."

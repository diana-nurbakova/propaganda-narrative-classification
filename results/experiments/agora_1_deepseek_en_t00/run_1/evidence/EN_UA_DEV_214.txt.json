      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes NATO, a Western alliance, portraying it as obsolete and a tool for aggressive expansion, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Western diplomatic and military structures."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China. So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict... it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "The statement shifts blame for the war's continuation and nature away from Russia (the invader) and onto China and the West, framing the West as waging a 'proxy war' and China as an 'enabler', thus deflecting responsibility from Russia."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's war effort and government by portraying it as callously sacrificing its own citizens, which attacks the legitimacy and actions of the Ukrainian leadership."

      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear by predicting the expansion of the conflict into a 'world war' or 'third world war', which is a classic fear-amplification tactic."

      "evidence_quote": "the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This highlights a negative outcome for the West (depleting its own arsenals without achieving victory), fitting the narrative of predicting or reporting adverse consequences for Western interests."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly questions the credibility of Western mainstream media and official narratives, labeling them as 'nonsense' and part of a losing 'disinformation war', which fosters distrust towards these media sources."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly states that the West is willing to prolong the war in Ukraine for its own strategic benefit (expanding to Asia), showing a callous disregard for Ukrainian lives, which are treated as expendable ('just Ukrainian lives after all')."

      "reasoning": "This statement presents the West as militarily ineffective and overextended, having emptied its arsenals yet failing to achieve victory, thereby portraying it as a non-potent force."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying NATO not as a legitimate defensive alliance but as an aggressive, expansionist tool of American power, which is a distinct argument not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West for prolonging and expanding the war, and also blames Ukraine ('Kyiv') for its conduct, which is a form of shifting blame away from the invader (Russia) but does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as cleanly. It is a distinct, leftover argument supporting the overarching narrative."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'proxy war' frames the conflict in Ukraine as a war orchestrated and fought by the West (using Ukraine as a proxy), rather than a war of Ukrainian national defense, directly supporting the narrative that Ukraine is controlled by Western powers."

      "reasoning": "This statement portrays the Ukrainian situation as a futile, protracted conflict where Ukrainian lives are being sacrificed in a war of attrition with no prospect of victory, emphasizing hopelessness and lack of positive future."

      "reasoning": "This statement broadly discredits the Western narrative and support for Ukraine by labeling it as 'nonsense' and a failed information war. It supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by undermining the legitimacy of the information space surrounding it, but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a third world war, framing the conflict's expansion as a deliberate act of globalizing war, which aligns with the subnarrative of warning against actions that risk WW3."

      "evidence_quote": "But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition, then expand it to Asia.",
      "reasoning": "The statement suggests the conflict will be deliberately expanded from Eastern Europe to Asia, implying an imminent threat of attack or conflict spreading to other regions, which matches the subnarrative of Russia (or the conflict) attacking other countries."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "Alarmingly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Nato as playing a “bridge” between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific theatres.",
      "reasoning": "This quote presents NATO's role as actively connecting and potentially intervening in two major global theaters (Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific), suggesting direct NATO involvement and expansion of its military reach, fitting the subnarrative of NATO direct intervention."

      "evidence_quote": "My Take | Nato barbarians are expanding and gathering at the gate of Asia - Most regional countries want none of it, but four Trojan horses – South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand – are ready to let them in",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by portraying NATO as an aggressive, expanding force ('barbarians') at Asia's gate, using regional allies as 'Trojan horses'. It supports the parent narrative of amplifying fear but does not fit neatly into the more specific definitions of WW3, nuclear weapons, Russia attacking others, or NATO intervention as defined."

      "evidence_quote": "So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western military support (a form of sanction/pressure) is depleting their own arsenals and failing to achieve victory, which aligns with the definition of catastrophizing the negative effects of Western actions against Russia."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western/American actions are leading to catastrophic global consequences, specifically the risk of a third world war. This is a negative consequence for the West and the world that does not fit the more specific subnarratives about sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly equates Western mainstream newsrooms with the corridors of power, framing them as part of a 'disinformation war' and implying they propagate 'nonsense' that few outside the West believe. This discredits Western media institutions as instruments of state propaganda."

      "evidence_quote": "Given his obvious mental decline, US President Joe Biden may be forgiven for claiming to ABC News’ host George Stephanopoulos that he was indispensable: “You know, not only am I campaigning, but I’m running the world.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement references a specific Western media outlet (ABC News) and its host in a dismissive and mocking context, using the interview to undermine the credibility of the US President. While it supports the broader narrative of distrust towards media/political messaging, it does not fit the specific definitions of discrediting Western or Ukrainian media institutions as propaganda instruments. It is a distinct, leftover argument contributing to the parent narrative."

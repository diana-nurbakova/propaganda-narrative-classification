      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "The quote attributes Germany's energy crisis and economic hardship to the sanctions regime and pipeline sabotage, framing these as consequences of the war, rather than attributing the primary cause to Russia's decision to invade Ukraine. It shifts the focus of blame onto Western policy responses."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet... Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly highlights severe negative economic outcomes (high electricity prices, inflation) for Germany and other European nations as a direct result of the disruption of Russian gas supplies, which is framed as a consequence of the geopolitical situation and sanctions."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity... But all of this was forsaken in the quixotic pursuit of a utopian vision of zero-carbon green energy.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes and discredits the energy and climate policies of the German (and by extension, Western) leadership, characterizing them as foolish, self-destructive, and driven by unrealistic ideology rather than practical sense."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "This narrative is not present in the text. The text is highly critical of Western (specifically German) policy and does not contain excessive or undue praise for Western virtues, accomplishments, or moral superiority.",

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly identifies the Western sanctions regime as a primary cause of Germany's energy crisis, shifting the blame for the economic consequences away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and onto the actions of the United States and the West."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What President Donald Trump was referring to in 2018 was Germany’s increasing dependence on Russian gas, which in turn resulted from “green” energy policies implemented over the previous decade. These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity... But all of this was forsaken in the quixotic pursuit of a utopian vision of zero-carbon green energy.",
      "reasoning": "This argument blames Germany's vulnerability and subsequent economic crisis on its own 'green fanaticism' and energy policies, which is a form of blaming the war's consequences on others (in this case, domestic political decisions and ideology) rather than on the invader, Russia. It supports the parent narrative by attributing the root cause of the problem to a party other than Russia."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes Germany's energy crisis and high costs to the Western sanctions regime against Russia, framing the sanctions as a self-inflicted wound that forces Germany into an emergency situation, which matches the definition of catastrophizing the negative effects of Western sanctions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West by detailing severe economic harm (high electricity prices, worse inflation) specifically to European nations (Germany, Italy) due to the disruption of Russian gas supplies, which is a consequence of the geopolitical conflict and sanctions. This economic harm is a distinct negative consequence not covered by the 'sanctions backfire' or 'refugee flows' subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links the West's sanctions regime against Russia to severe negative consequences for Germany, framing the Western response as a disproportionate and self-destructive overreaction that harms its own member states more than it helps."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This statement highlights differential impacts within Europe, presenting the EU not as a unified bloc but as a set of divided entities with conflicting interests and suffering, which aligns with the subnarrative of a divided EU."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity... But all of this was forsaken in the quixotic pursuit of a utopian vision of zero-carbon green energy.",
      "reasoning": "While not mentioning Ukraine directly, the core argument is that Western (specifically German) policies were driven by ideological 'green fanaticism' and not by strategic or humanitarian concerns. The text frames the sanctions and energy crisis as a consequence of these self-interested, misguided Western policies, implicitly arguing that the West's actions (like sanctions) are not primarily about helping Ukraine but are rooted in its own flawed internal agendas that ultimately harm itself."

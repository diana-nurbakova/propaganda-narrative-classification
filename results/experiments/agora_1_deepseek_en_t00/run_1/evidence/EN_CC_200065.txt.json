      "reasoning": "The quote directly challenges the scientific basis for claims about long-term temperature records by highlighting the short duration of instrumental data collection, casting doubt on the methods used to make historical comparisons."

      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses a NASA statement to question the validity and comparability of paleoclimate proxy data, which is central to the scientific claims being reported, thereby sowing doubt about the scientific methodology."

      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question sarcastically implies that the reported climate science is not driven by evidence but is instead a sensationalized narrative, thereby downplaying the significance and validity of the climate change warnings."

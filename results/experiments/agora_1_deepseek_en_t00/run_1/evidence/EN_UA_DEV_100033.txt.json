      "evidence_quote": "“We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself... The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.” The host chimed in to ask: “Are you including Alaska and Fort Ross?” Matveychev nodded: “That was my next point. As well as the Antarctic... We discovered it, so it belongs to us...",
      "reasoning": "Listing territorial claims against the United States (Alaska) and global claims (Antarctic) presents Russia as having expansionist ambitions beyond Ukraine, implying future attacks or conflicts with other nations."

      "evidence_quote": "“To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.” Russian state media and government officials have taken to describing any opponents of the Kremlin in Ukraine as or “Banderites,” the followers of Stepan Bandera, the ultranationalist political figure... This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly labels Ukrainian opponents as 'Banderites,' a term used to associate them with historical ultranationalist figures and, by extension, Nazi ideology, which is a core element of the subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly delegitimizes Ukrainian government officials and leaders by labeling them as 'war criminals' subject to extradition, which aims to portray the Ukrainian government as criminal and illegitimate."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "In the surreal world of Russian state television, Russia is about to prevail in its war against Ukraine, which is being presented as a battle against the United States and NATO.",
      "reasoning": "This framing presents the conflict not as a war with Ukraine itself, but as a proxy battle against the U.S. and NATO, implying Ukraine is merely a tool or puppet of Western powers."

      "evidence_quote": "“There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote, while criticizing the US, implies a broader global perspective where Russia's view is validated by the perceived weakness of its primary adversary, suggesting a form of indirect international alignment or superiority that supports the narrative of Russia's international standing."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“We can take them down without it.” (in response to a question about using nuclear strikes)",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by praising Russia's military and strategic capability, suggesting it can achieve victory over adversaries without resorting to its ultimate weapons. It promotes an image of superior strength and restraint, but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives like 'Praise of Russian military might' (which is more about institutions/equipment) or the others listed."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the West's (U.S. and NATO) reluctance to intervene militarily as proof of weakness, allowing Russia to act with impunity, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as non-potent."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the American public is indifferent to Ukraine's fate, suggesting Western support is not driven by genuine concern for Ukraine but by other, unstated interests (contrasted here with domestic concerns like gas prices)."

      "reasoning": "This fabricated quote is used to portray Western (U.S.) statements as hysterical and alarmist, suggesting they are inventing extreme scenarios (like nuclear use) to which they themselves would not respond, thereby framing the West's rhetorical stance as an overreaction."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Matveychev noted: “There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West by portraying the United States as gullible and easily controlled, which is a distinct claim not covered by the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, lack of care, failed diplomacy, or fatigue)."

      "evidence_quote": "“We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that too costs money and we should get it back.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames Western sanctions as causing damage to Russia, for which Russia will demand financial reparations from the West, implying the sanctions will ultimately cost the West money."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“Here’s what will be on the table after our victory... The dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way... The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by outlining extreme negative consequences for the West (dissolution of NATO, seizure of assets) following a Russian victory, but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to negotiate with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is being packaged as a sign of his love and good will, and not the consequence of mounting losses and humiliating defeats faced by the Russian military in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that the Russian military is facing 'mounting losses and humiliating defeats,' which is a clear claim of a significant decline in its effectiveness and strength, matching the definition of the subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on the outcome of the war, predicting Western defeat and reparations to Moscow. It supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes but does not fit the specific definitions about the collapse of either army or the loss of occupied territories; it is a broader speculative claim about the conflict's resolution."

      "reasoning": "This distorted claim amplifies war-related fears by presenting a scenario of extreme Russian escalation (biological/nuclear weapons) with an implied consequence of Western inaction, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific definitions of the other subnarratives (e.g., it's about a specific claimed Western policy response to escalation, not directly about causing WW3, attacking other countries, NATO intervention, or solely nuclear use)."

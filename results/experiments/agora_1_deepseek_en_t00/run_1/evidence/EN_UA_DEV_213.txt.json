      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the integrity and motives of Western media, labeling it 'filthy pro-imperialist' and questioning the source of war narratives."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This frames Russia's potential actions as a justified, defensive response to NATO expansion, portraying Russia as a nation under threat and victimized by Western encirclement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies... are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This statement evokes fear by asserting that Western actions are deliberately leading to war, presenting conflict as an imminent and intended goal."
    },

      "evidence_quote": "The answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism... the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.",
      "reasoning": "This highlights severe internal crises within the United States, predicting or reporting negative domestic consequences that undermine its position."

      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the conflict and its escalation to the United States and its European allies, portraying them as the deliberate instigators seeking war, which aligns with the definition of blaming the West as the aggressors."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the war on others (specifically Ukrainian forces and their US advisers for planning a false-flag operation), but it does not fit neatly into the 'Ukraine is the aggressor' subnarrative (which portrays Ukraine as the attacker) or the 'West are the aggressors' subnarrative (which focuses on Western responsibility). It is a distinct argument shifting blame from Russia to a hybrid actor (Ukraine with US backing)."

      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented...",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly accuses Western governments and media of generating alarmist claims about a Russian invasion without evidence, framing their reaction as disproportionate and based on lies."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames Western actions as not genuinely about Ukraine's welfare, but rather using the country as a 'pretext' for their own geopolitical confrontation with Russia, prioritizing their interests over Ukraine's fate."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted. It writes: 'With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.'",
      "reasoning": "The text cites and endorses the view that the diplomatic window is closing or was never open, presenting diplomatic efforts as futile or not genuinely pursued by the West, thereby discrediting the potential of diplomacy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western motives, suggesting the escalation is a cynical domestic political diversion. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, fatigue, or overreaction in the defined sense, but about malicious intent)."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses specific Western media outlets (NYT, WaPo) of being part of a disinformation campaign, presenting lies as fact to manipulate public opinion, which aligns with the definition of Western media as an instrument of propaganda."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly discredits media across the Atlantic as 'filthy pro-imperialist,' supporting the parent narrative of distrust towards media. However, it does not exclusively target Ukrainian media nor does it solely define Western media as a propaganda instrument in the specific way the first quote does; it is a more general, vitriolic condemnation that serves as distinct evidence for the narrative."

      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the narrative of an impending Russian invasion as a deliberate, biased fabrication by Western governments and media, suggesting the negative reaction is rooted in a hostile, anti-Russian perspective rather than facts."

      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This quote justifies Russia's posture and potential actions as a necessary and defensive response to NATO's eastward expansion and its intention to incorporate Ukraine, framing Russia as reacting to an external threat."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests Ukraine, with US backing, is actively planning a 'false-flag' operation to justify conflict, portraying Ukraine as an extremist actor hostile to Russia and manipulated by external powers."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as a victim of Western/NATO ultimatums that infringe on its sovereignty, an argument that fits the 'Russia is the Victim' theme but is not captured by the more specific subnarratives provided."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that NATO should take a more direct and aggressive military action (delivering lethal weapons) in the conflict, which aligns with the subnarrative definition of suggesting NATO ought to or will take direct military action."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by accusing the US and NATO of deliberately seeking war, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions about WW3, attacking other countries, nuclear weapons, or direct NATO intervention. It is a general amplification of the fear of intentional escalation leading to war."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that US military interventions (a form of aggressive Western policy) have backfired, leading to disasters contrary to US intentions, which aligns with the idea that Western actions (like sanctions or escalation) will have negative, self-defeating consequences."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western (US) escalation is driven by a domestic crisis and implies that pursuing conflict will not solve but rather is a symptom of deep internal problems, suggesting negative consequences stemming from the West's own dysfunctional state."

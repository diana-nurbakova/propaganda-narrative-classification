      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "After multiple instances of vandalism against famous landmarks and artistic works of western cultural significance, many people are growing annoyed with the actions of climate alarmists.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the actions and methods of climate activists, framing them as 'alarmists' whose vandalism is causing public annoyance, which aligns with the narrative of challenging the motives, integrity, or impact of the climate movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical statement '(it's not)' explicitly denies that man-made climate change is a legitimate threat, which directly minimizes the significance and validity of climate change."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This statement casts doubt on climate science by suggesting that seasonal heat is falsely presented as evidence for global warming and that the predictions based on this science fail to come true, thereby questioning the scientific consensus and data."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda, blind belief in climate hysteria is on the decline.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'billions of dollars spent yearly... on climate propaganda' questions the financial expenditure and underlying motives of climate policies and initiatives, framing them as wasteful and propagandistic rather than effective."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Climate protests will likely increase in the next two months, with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames climate activists as exploiting normal seasonal weather to push exaggerated and unfulfilled predictions, aligning with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist and exaggerating the severity of climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "SEND THEM TO JAIL…or bury them under the fairway. Whatevs.",
      "reasoning": "This statement, presented as a social media reaction, constitutes a direct and extreme personal attack on the protesters, advocating for severe punishment and dehumanization, which fits the definition of ad hominem attacks on activists."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Their defacement of Stonehenge could be considered relatively successful because no one was able to stop them. It's impossible to understand the logic behind the focus on an ancient site created thousands of year before the development of carbon based energy. However, climate activists seem to be more concerned with media coverage than making sense.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement's tactics as illogical, counterproductive, and primarily driven by a desire for media attention rather than genuine environmental concern. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks' as defined."

      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "This direct statement explicitly denies that human-caused (man-made) climate change is a real threat, fitting the definition of arguing that human activities do not impact climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Downplaying climate change: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda, blind belief in climate hysteria is on the decline.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase frames mainstream climate science and concern as 'propaganda' and 'hysteria,' which is a general strategy to downplay the significance and validity of climate change. It supports the parent narrative but does not fit a more specific subnarrative definition from the list."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Data shows no temperature increase",
      "evidence_quote": "global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly asserts that the predicted outcomes of climate science (global warming) are not occurring, which aligns with the subnarrative that data does not support claims of temperature increase."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly rejects the core scientific consensus that human activity is causing climate change, supporting the parent narrative of questioning the science. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about methodologies, data, or the scientific community's reliability, as it is a broad dismissal of the foundational premise."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda, blind belief in climate hysteria is on the decline.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that significant financial investment in climate-related efforts (a proxy for policies and advocacy) is failing to achieve its intended goal of convincing the public, implying the policies and messaging are ineffective."

      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement's tactics and public relations, arguing their actions are counterproductive to their cause. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies/movements but does not fit the specific definitions about economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

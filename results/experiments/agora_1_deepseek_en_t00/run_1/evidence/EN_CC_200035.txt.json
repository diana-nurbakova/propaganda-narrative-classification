      "reasoning": "This quote highlights an unknown financial burden on taxpayers, implicitly questioning the economic prudence and feasibility of the policy, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing climate policies for their economic impact."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This statement associates the push for electric vehicles with controversial foreign investments and geopolitical rivals, casting doubt on the integrity and security of the green technology supply chain."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the governor's EV policy as being linked to investments with a foreign geopolitical adversary (the CCP), suggesting environmental policies are being used to facilitate or are intertwined with geopolitical influence rather than being purely for environmental benefit."

      "reasoning": "This quote highlights an unknown financial burden on taxpayers, framing the policy as potentially economically irresponsible and negatively impacting public finances."

      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "This quote, and the subsequent discussion of specific Chinese-linked corporate investments (Gotion, CATL), frames the policy as being driven by questionable foreign corporate partnerships and financial interests rather than pure environmental benefit."

      "evidence_quote": "The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the policy by highlighting strong local opposition and political backlash, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "evidence_quote": "The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly highlights the unknown financial burden of the transition, framing the adoption of electric vehicles (a key green technology) as potentially expensive and a risk to taxpayers, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable/green energy is costly."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)... The plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.",
      "reasoning": "This section of the text introduces controversy around the green energy transition by associating it with foreign (Chinese) influence, political unpopularity, and negative local consequences. It supports the parent narrative of 'Controversy about green technologies' but does not fit the definitions of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear unfriendliness. It is a distinct argument creating controversy."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "Whitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly links the state's green energy policy (electrifying the fleet) to investments involving Chinese corporations tied to the CCP, framing the policy as a vehicle for foreign (specifically Chinese) influence and control within the state, which aligns with the neo-colonialism subnarrative of external powers exerting control through green initiatives."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Gotion Inc., linked to the CCP, plans to build a $2.4 billion EV battery plant in the Big Rapids, Michigan, area at Whitmer’s behest.",
      "reasoning": "This quote, along with the mention of Ford's partnership with CATL (a Chinese battery supplier with CCP ties), supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments. However, the specific argument—that a state's domestic green policy directly facilitates and is entangled with the economic and strategic interests of a foreign geopolitical rival (China)—is not fully captured by the 'neo-colonialism' definition, which typically implies control over developing nations. This constitutes distinct, leftover evidence for the parent narrative."

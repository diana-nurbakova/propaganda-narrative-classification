      "evidence_quote": "Climate cultists push bizarre scare language about weather: “rain bombs” and “boiling oceans”",
      "reasoning": "The opening phrase 'Climate cultists' is a derogatory term that challenges the integrity and rationality of the climate movement, framing their language as 'bizarre' and alarmist."

      "evidence_quote": "\"That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers, and the rain bombs, and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level, and causing these waves of climate refugees, predicted to reach one billion in this century.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quoted statement from Al Gore, presented in the text, lists catastrophic consequences and uses dramatic terms like 'boiling the oceans' and 'rain bombs,' which serves to emphasize and amplify fears about climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "The legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for \"renewable energy,\" meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the Inflation Reduction Act's funding for renewable energy, questioning its effectiveness and economic impact by suggesting it will lead to a 'dark and cold future,' thereby challenging the policy's motives and outcomes."

      "reasoning": "This commenter's statement minimizes the significance of climate change by asserting that past predictions have consistently failed, thereby downplaying the current threat and impact."

      "reasoning": "This quote raises doubts about the scientific consensus and predictions related to climate change by citing an alleged track record of failed forecasts, thereby questioning the reliability of the underlying science and data."

      "reasoning": "This statement attacks Al Gore's personal credibility and reputation by highlighting his alleged hypocrisy and lavish lifestyle, rather than engaging with his arguments, fitting the definition of an ad hominem attack on a key activist."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes climate policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) by portraying its outcomes negatively ('a very dark and cold future'), which supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit the specific definitions of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks provided."

      "evidence_quote": "\"the accumulated amount is now trapping as much extra heat as would be released by 600,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs exploding every single day on the Earth\" ... \"That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers, and the rain bombs, and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level, and causing these waves of climate refugees, predicted to reach one billion in this century.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote presents an intense, catastrophic scenario involving extreme weather, sea-level rise, and a massive displacement of one billion people, directly matching the definition of presenting doomsday scenarios for humans as a result of climate change."

      "reasoning": "The text uses exaggerated and alarming language like 'boiling the oceans' and 'rain bombs' to describe climate effects, speculating on severe side effects to spread panic, which aligns with amplifying existing fears of global warming."

      "reasoning": "This quote, while presented as a critique, references and amplifies a litany of past catastrophic climate predictions (e.g., mass extinction, famine, flooding) within the article's framing, supporting the parent narrative of amplifying climate fears through a historical catalog of alarmist claims. It does not fit the other specific subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames climate policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) as a massive financial appropriation that will fund specific industries (windmills, solar panels), implying the policy is driven by corporate or financial interests ('appropriation funds') rather than genuine environmental benefit, which aligns with the 'only for profit' subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote, from a commenter included in the text, directly argues that the predictions and scenarios used to justify climate policies have consistently failed to materialize, suggesting the underlying rationale and thus the policies themselves are ineffective."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames renewable energy investment as a massive, wasteful expenditure that will lead to a negative outcome ('dark and cold future'), aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive and not worth adopting."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Renewable energy ... is now the cheapest source of electricity in almost the entire planet,\" Gore lied.",
      "reasoning": "By labeling Gore's statement about renewable energy being cheap as a lie, the text implicitly argues against its economic viability and, by extension, its reliability as a dependable energy source for widespread use."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "in exchange for globalist \"green\" energy.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase frames the push for renewable energy as part of a 'globalist' agenda, which is a distinct argument supporting the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies but does not fit the definitions of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy."

Global cooling, global warming, mass extinction, mass famine, the polar ice caps melting, mass flooding, the ozone layer depleted, etc.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly supports the parent narrative of downplaying climate change by dismissing climate concerns as failed, alarmist predictions. It does not fit any of the specific scientific denial subnarratives (e.g., about natural cycles, CO2 impact, or sea levels) but instead uses a broad, historical argument to undermine the credibility of climate warnings."

      "evidence_quote": "US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war",
      "reasoning": "The headline and core argument directly attribute the cause of potential war to the actions of the US and NATO, shifting blame away from Russia as the potential aggressor."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia.",

    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly attacks the integrity and motives of Western media, labeling them as 'filthy pro-imperialist' to undermine their credibility."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim",
      "evidence_quote": "How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames Russia's potential military actions as a justified and defensive response to NATO expansion, portraying Russia as a victim of Western encirclement."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies... are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly asserts that Western actions are intentionally leading to war, evoking fear about imminent and deliberate conflict escalation."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the conflict and its escalation to the United States and its European allies, portraying them as the deliberate instigators seeking war, which aligns with the definition of blaming the West as the aggressors."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the potential for a 'false-flag' operation on Ukrainian forces and their US advisers, shifting responsibility away from Russia. It does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' subnarrative (which portrays Ukraine as the primary attacker) nor the 'West are the aggressors' subnarrative (which focuses on Western states as the primary instigators), as it focuses on a specific covert action attributed to a Ukrainian-US collaboration."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses Western governments and media of fabricating and exaggerating the threat of a Russian invasion without evidence, framing their reaction as disproportionate and alarmist."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that Western support for Ukraine is not genuine concern for the country, but rather a 'pretext' for their own geopolitical confrontation with Russia, prioritizing their interests over Ukraine's fate."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work",
      "evidence_quote": "The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted. It writes: 'With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.'",
      "reasoning": "The text cites and endorses the view that the diplomatic window is closing or was never open, presenting diplomatic efforts as futile and implying that the West is not genuinely interested in a negotiated resolution."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by discrediting Western motives, suggesting the escalation is a cynical domestic political ploy rather than a genuine foreign policy. This specific claim—that conflict is sought to distract from domestic crisis—does not fit any of the other defined subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses specific Western media outlets (NYT, WaPo) of leading a disinformation campaign, presenting lies as fact to manipulate public opinion, which aligns with the definition of Western media being an instrument of propaganda."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "This statement broadly discredits media across the Atlantic as 'filthy pro-imperialist,' supporting the parent narrative of distrust towards media but not fitting neatly into the specific subnarratives about Western or Ukrainian media alone, as it targets a broader category."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence",
      "evidence_quote": "Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames any potential Russian military action as a defensive and understandable reaction to NATO's eastward expansion and its intention to incorporate Ukraine, thereby justifying Russia's posture as self-defence against external threat."

      "evidence_quote": "All the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented... As it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Western governments and media as maliciously fabricating evidence and promoting lies about Russian aggression, suggesting the negative reaction is driven by a biased, anti-Russian perspective rather than facts."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists",
      "evidence_quote": "In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests Ukraine, with US backing, is planning a 'false-flag' operation, portraying Ukrainian forces as extremist proxies actively working against Russia, which aligns with the narrative of Ukraine being comprised of anti-Russian elements."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia as a victim of Western/NATO demands that infringe on its sovereignty and treat it like a defeated nation, a theme not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene",
      "evidence_quote": "Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests that NATO should take a more direct and aggressive military action (delivering lethal weapons) in the conflict, which aligns with the subnarrative definition of suggesting NATO ought to or will take direct military action."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by accusing the US and NATO of deliberately seeking war with Russia, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions about WW3, attacking other countries, nuclear weapons, or direct NATO intervention."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly attacks the character and legitimacy of the Ukrainian state by asserting widespread, pre-existing corruption, which aligns with the narrative of undermining Ukraine's societal and governmental integrity."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the motives of Western (specifically American) aid, portraying it as self-interested and hypocritical rather than genuinely supportive, which fits the narrative of discrediting Western actions and diplomacy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "While the text itself provides context, the mention of accusations that a journalist is spreading 'Russian propaganda' for 'thinly sourced claims' introduces a frame that questions the reliability and integrity of media reporting on the war, aligning with the distrust towards media narrative."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly portrays the Ukrainian government and its systems as inherently and historically corrupt, delegitimizing its governance and policies by suggesting aid is being stolen."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities",
      "evidence_quote": "War is a business, and the business of war is going on in Ukraine. The over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames Ukraine as a center for illegal war profiteering, massive fraud, and the potential diversion of weapons, aligning with the definition of Ukraine being a hub for criminal activities."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by suggesting its corruption is undermining Western public and political support, which is a distinct theme not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives listed."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "The American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western (specifically American) support for Ukraine is driven by self-interest (protecting Europe/NATO from Russia) rather than genuine concern for Ukraine's people or fate, matching the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "The even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.",
      "reasoning": "This quote claims that revelations of corruption are causing the American public and taxpayers to become less willing to support Ukraine financially, indicating growing fatigue and disinterest, which aligns with the 'West is tired of Ukraine' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "Pulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames a respected Western journalist (Hersh) as being 'accused of spreading Russian propaganda' for his reporting, implying that the Western media establishment labels dissenting or critical reporting as propaganda, thus portraying Western media as a tool for controlling the narrative rather than reporting truth."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This thinly sourced statement, however, skims over the complexities of a very nuanced war. It is not a statement that can exist without a deeper explanation–and that explanation takes the wind out of the sails of a very damaging allegation.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes the quality and completeness of media reporting (specifically Hersh's blog), suggesting it is simplistic and misleading. This supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by arguing that media reports lack necessary context and nuance, thereby undermining their credibility, but does not fit the specific definitions of distrusting Western or Ukrainian media as institutions."

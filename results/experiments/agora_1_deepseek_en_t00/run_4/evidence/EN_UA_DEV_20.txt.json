      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto Western nations (the UK and US), framing them as the actors who prevented a peaceful settlement."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine. As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "This passage undermines Ukraine's military and governmental effectiveness by highlighting desperate and potentially unpopular conscription measures, portraying the state as struggling and coercive."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Western (and Ukrainian) policy as reckless and counterproductive, directly discrediting their diplomatic and military strategy as pointless and dangerous."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the prolongation of the war on Ukraine and its Western backers for their escalatory actions, which is a form of shifting blame away from the initial invader, Russia. It does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' subnarratives as neatly, as it focuses on current escalation rather than the original cause, but it clearly supports the overarching narrative of blaming others for the war's continuation."

      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by highlighting the failure of a major military operation and net territorial loss."

      "reasoning": "This portrays Ukraine's military situation as having no viable path to victory, emphasizing a lack of manpower and an inability to achieve its stated goals, which frames the future as hopeless."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by portraying its government and its Western allies as reckless and irresponsible, prolonging suffering for no strategic gain. This specific argument—accusing Ukraine of pointless escalation—does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly contrasts Russia's strong and increasing military production with the West's comparatively weaker output, presenting the West as non-potent and unable to match Russia's war effort."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",

      "reasoning": "This statement claims Western powers (UK and US) sabotaged a potential peace deal that would have benefited Ukraine, prioritizing a continued conflict (presumably for their own geopolitical interests) over Ukrainian lives and sovereignty."

      "reasoning": "This concluding statement frames current Western policy as a fantasy of military victory and implies that diplomatic efforts ('work this conflict out with words') are being ignored or rejected by the West, discrediting the potential of ongoing diplomatic efforts."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying Western-backed actions as reckless, escalatory, and counterproductive. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives but clearly aims to discredit Western strategy and decision-making."

      "evidence_quote": "Instead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly warns against continuing a large-scale offensive against Russia, framing it as a dangerous fantasy that could lead to a catastrophic escalation, implicitly evoking the fear of a world war if diplomacy is not pursued."

      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly evokes fear by claiming that recent escalatory actions are moving the world toward a 'catastrophic nuclear accident,' directly supporting the subnarrative about the risk of nuclear weapons being employed."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "President Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia. Around the same time, Ukraine struck two Russian strategic nuclear early-warning radars... The escalations have not been one-sided. Russia conducted drills simulating the use of strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus and has sent warships and a submarine to the Caribbean.",
      "reasoning": "This detailed description of reciprocal escalatory actions (NATO-allowed strikes into Russia, attacks on nuclear early-warning systems, Russian nuclear drills, and naval deployments) amplifies war-related fears by depicting a dangerous tit-for-tat spiral. While it touches on nuclear themes, its primary focus is on the broader, escalating conflict dynamics that heighten fear and tension, which is not fully captured by the more specific subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "At the same time, the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers that no amount of foreign aid or equipment transfers can do anything to alleviate... As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly describes a significant decline in the Ukrainian military's manpower and effectiveness, suggesting it is struggling to sustain its fighting force, which aligns with the definition of the Ukrainian army collapsing."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv.",
      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on a war outcome—that Ukraine cannot achieve its military objectives and will not be able to liberate occupied territories. It supports the parent narrative of speculating on war outcomes but does not perfectly match the provided specific subnarratives (e.g., it implies Ukraine cannot win back territory, but does not explicitly state 'Russian army will lose all occupied territories')."

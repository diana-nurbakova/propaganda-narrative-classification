      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of essential goods and housing to 'green' policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "The opening statement directly challenges the competence and intentions of the Biden administration by blaming its policies for making housing unaffordable."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses strong skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar, labeling them as inefficient, expensive, environmentally destructive, and incapable of meeting energy demands."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames green policies as weakening America's strategic and military position, suggesting they are tools that undermine national strength in geopolitical competition rather than being purely for environmental benefit."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring. \"And these elevated prices for essentials factor into price increases for everything else.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of housing, fuel, and utilities to climate policies, framing them as a primary economic burden on Americans and a driver of inflation."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "\"These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that the promoted renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are environmentally harmful and incapable of meeting energy demands, thereby criticizing the effectiveness of the policy's core energy transition."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames climate policies as a national security liability, weakening America. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the definitions of the specific economic, ineffectiveness, or profit-driven subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "This direct statement criticizes the policies of the U.S. national government (under President Biden) for causing negative economic consequences, specifically unaffordable housing, which aligns with disapproving of how a national government handles climate-related policy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "who warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' is used to discredit and criticize the political figure (President Biden) and his administration's approach to climate policy, framing it as a harmful, ideologically driven plan."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes... Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes.",
      "reasoning": "This criticizes a specific government agency (the Department of Energy) and its program, portraying it as a coercive and financially burdensome top-down mandate that exacerbates housing affordability issues. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives targeting the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures alone, as it focuses on a federal agency's regulatory action."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is unreliable",
      "evidence_quote": "These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are incapable of meeting the energy demands of the nation or world, which aligns with the definition of unreliability for widespread adoption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly labels renewable energy sources as 'inefficient and expensive,' directly supporting the subnarrative that they are too costly and inefficient for widespread use."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance",
      "reasoning": "The claim that renewable energy generation is 'far more destructive to the environment' and requires intensive resource extraction positions it as posing significant risks, aligning with the 'dangerous' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,' wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This argument directly supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies by blaming them for broad socioeconomic harms (housing and cost of living crises), but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about the energy sources themselves being dangerous, unreliable, costly, or nuclear not being climate-friendly."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the domestic economic consequences of green policies (unaffordable housing, energy) as a national security weakness, implying that these policies are a form of geopolitical self-sabotage that leaves the country vulnerable to adversaries, which aligns with the idea of international climate relations being exploitative or abusive to national strength."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Edward Ring... warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' directly frames the policies as instruments of a supranational or international agenda, which supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments. This specific phrasing does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives but clearly advances the core idea that climate policy is a tool for broader geopolitical control or influence."

This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”",

The segment was entitled “Denazification of Ukraine—the new opportunities for growth” and appeared to serve as a tool to desensitize the Russian population for the grotesque war trials and executions the Kremlin is reportedly planning to conduct in Ukraine...",
      "reasoning": "This segment promotes the idea of public executions and 'denazification' as a policy for Ukraine, which supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by portraying it as a territory requiring brutal, extra-judicial punishment. This extreme dehumanization and call for violence does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

The dissolution of NATO... Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko... Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko.”",
      "reasoning": "The text describes state TV broadcasting clips of Western figures like Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump, and the pundit's monologue implies that the West is weak and manipulable, suggesting that Russia's position is strong and that it can dictate terms internationally, which aligns with the theme of Russia having leverage and support on the global stage."

The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote, along with others detailing expansive future demands (dissolution of NATO, extradition of figures, claims on Alaska/Antarctic), supports the parent narrative of praising Russia by portraying it as supremely powerful, victorious, and entitled to dictate global terms. This grand, triumphalist vision of Russia's future does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the West's (U.S. and NATO) reluctance to intervene militarily as proof of weakness, allowing Russia to act with impunity, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as non-potent."

      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the American public is indifferent to Ukraine's fate, suggesting Western support is not driven by genuine concern for Ukraine but by other, likely self-serving, interests."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West by presenting a catastrophic ultimatum: the West must either pay reparations (a financial/political negative consequence) or face nuclear war (an existential negative consequence). This goes beyond the specific 'sanctions backfire' or 'refugee flows' subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on the outcome of the war, predicting a Russian victory and Western defeat/concessions. It supports the parent narrative of speculating war outcomes but does not fit the specific definitions of army collapse or losing territories; it is a broader, speculative claim about the conflict's end result."

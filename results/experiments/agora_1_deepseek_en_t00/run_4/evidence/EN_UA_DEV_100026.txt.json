      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet... Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly highlights adverse economic outcomes (high electricity prices, inflation) for Germany and other European nations as a consequence of the disruption of Russian gas, which is framed as a result of the sanctions regime and geopolitical crisis related to the Russia-Ukraine war."

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock...",
      "reasoning": "The text lists the war, Western sanctions, and pipeline sabotage as causes of Germany's energy crisis. By grouping the war with the sanctions and sabotage as causative factors, it implicitly shifts blame away from Russia's invasion as the primary cause, instead framing the Western response as equally or more responsible for the negative consequences."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question directly criticizes and discredits the competence and judgment of German (and by extension, Western) leadership, blaming them for the economic suffering through their 'idiocy' in energy and climate policy."

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes Germany's energy crisis and high costs to the Western sanctions regime against Russia, framing the sanctions as a self-inflicted wound that forces Germany into a desperate and expensive scramble for alternatives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This passage details severe negative economic consequences (soaring electricity prices and inflation) for Germany and other European nations as a direct result of the disruption of Russian gas supplies, which is linked to the conflict and sanctions. It supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West but does not fit the specific definitions of 'sanctions backfire' (which is already covered) or 'refugee flows'."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly identifies the Western sanctions regime as a primary cause of Germany's energy crisis, shifting the responsibility for the economic consequences away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and onto the actions of the United States and the West."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What President Donald Trump was referring to in 2018 was Germany’s increasing dependence on Russian gas, which in turn resulted from “green” energy policies implemented over the previous decade. These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity... But all of this was forsaken in the quixotic pursuit of a utopian vision of zero-carbon green energy.",
      "reasoning": "This argument blames Germany's vulnerability and subsequent economic crisis on its own 'green fanaticism' and energy policies, which is a form of blaming the war's consequences on others (in this case, domestic and EU climate policy) rather than on the invader, Russia. It supports the parent narrative by attributing the root cause of the problem to a party other than Russia."

      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a division within the EU, specifically between nations that were heavily reliant on Russian gas and those that were not, suggesting the bloc is not a unified entity and suffers from differing economic consequences due to its policies."

      "evidence_quote": "Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This statement presents a core Western European power, Germany, as economically crippled and failing due to its own policies, thereby portraying the West as weakened and self-sabotaging."

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock...",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the Western sanctions regime as a direct cause of Germany's energy crisis and economic hardship, implying the West's reaction (sanctions) has been disproportionate and self-destructive."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error.",
      "reasoning": "This implies that the sacrifices Germany is making (ostensibly in support of Western policies related to Ukraine/Russia) are futile and driven by ideological virtue-signaling rather than a genuine concern for Ukraine's fate, suggesting the West's actions are self-interested and misguided."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames the Western sanctions regime as a necessary and morally justified response to the Russia-Ukraine war, implicitly placing the West on the 'right side' of the conflict by depicting its actions (sanctions) as defensive measures to protect values and security, despite the severe economic consequences for Germany."

      "evidence_quote": "What President Donald Trump was referring to in 2018 was Germany’s increasing dependence on Russian gas, which in turn resulted from “green” energy policies implemented over the previous decade.",
      "reasoning": "This statement, while critical of German policy, implicitly praises and validates the foresight and strategic position of a Western leader (Trump) and by extension the broader Western stance against reliance on Russian energy, supporting the overarching narrative of Western superiority in geopolitical judgment."

      "evidence_quote": "By depriving rural residents of their right to just say no to green energy scams, the state-level \"greenies\" who control California, Illinois, Michigan and New York are pandering to corporate interests while lining their own pockets, all at the expense of their constituents.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the implementation and motives behind state-level green energy policies, framing them as 'scams' that serve corporate and political interests while harming local constituents, which aligns with the definition of questioning the effectiveness and motives of climate policies."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by framing them as a 'scam' that harms national interests and benefits foreign adversaries. This argument does not fit the definitions of the more specific subnarratives about ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive, as it introduces a distinct theme of geopolitical harm and national security."

      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes state-level bureaucratic institutions and authorities for overriding local governance and being corrupt, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit neatly into the more specific subcategories of national governments, EU, international entities, or political figures alone."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by depicting green policies as a coercive, top-down instrument used by state and federal governments to override local autonomy and dispossess citizens for corporate gain, which is a distinct argument not captured by the more specific 'neo-colonialism' or 'abusive international relations' subnarratives."

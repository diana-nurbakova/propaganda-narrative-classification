      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly raises doubt about the scientific basis for claims of long-term temperature records by highlighting the short duration of instrumental data collection, which aligns with the narrative's definition of casting doubt on scientific methods and data."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, “scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,’” NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote uses a NASA statement to question the validity and comparability of paleoclimate proxy data, which is a core tactic of the 'Questioning the measurements and science' narrative."

      "reasoning": "The term 'climate alarmists' is a pejorative label that challenges the credibility and motives of those raising climate concerns, fitting the definition of criticizing the climate movement's integrity and impact."

      "evidence_quote": "Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert...",
      "reasoning": "Describing the claims as 'extravagant' frames the climate movement's statements as exaggerated and lacking in restraint, which is a form of criticism targeting their motives and impact."

      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question sarcastically suggests that the alarming climate claims are merely a sensational 'story' rather than a serious scientific conclusion, thereby minimizing the significance of the reported climate data and impacts."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by questioning the validity of long-term temperature claims based on the limited timeframe of direct data collection. It does not fit the specific definitions of questioning data reliability, denying temperature increase, denying the greenhouse effect, or attacking the scientific community's reliability, but it clearly questions the scientific basis of the measurements."

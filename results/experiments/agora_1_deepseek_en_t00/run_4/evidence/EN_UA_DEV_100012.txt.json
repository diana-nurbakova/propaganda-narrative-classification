      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the US's motivation for involvement in the war as securing access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, implying the conflict is driven by Western economic interests rather than Russia's act of invasion."
    },

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Graham is treating Ukraine as a future colony of the US with his comments on the ownership of the country's natural resources... 'The fate of the colonies is always the same: the Americans will scoop up all the natural resources of Ukraine in exchange for 'the great honor of being a friend of the United States''",
      "reasoning": "The text, through the Russian official's statement, directly criticizes and discredits Western (specifically US) intentions, portraying them as colonial and exploitative rather than supportive."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote attacks the legitimacy of Ukraine's leadership by labeling it as both 'corrupt' and a 'neo-Nazi regime', which is a common narrative to undermine the Ukrainian government."

      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the US/West's motivation for the conflict as securing access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, shifting the responsibility for the war's continuation from Russia's invasion to Western economic aggression."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "“If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West,”",
      "reasoning": "This attributed quote from Senator Graham portrays Western aid as a transactional investment for resource extraction, supporting the narrative that the West's primary goal is economic gain, not Ukrainian sovereignty, thus blaming them for the conflict's dynamics."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "Graham is treating Ukraine as a future colony of the US with his comments on the ownership of the country's natural resources",
      "reasoning": "This statement by a Russian official explicitly characterizes US involvement as colonial exploitation, directly assigning aggressive, imperialist motives to the West as the driving force behind the conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by accusing the West of sustaining a corrupt and ideologically extreme Ukrainian government, which is a distinct argument not covered by the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' subnarratives."
    },

      "evidence_quote": "\"Washington 'cannot afford' to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames Western support for Ukraine as being primarily motivated by economic self-interest and access to resources, rather than genuine concern for Ukraine's sovereignty or people."

      "reasoning": "These quotes present the West's involvement as a form of neo-colonial exploitation, where Ukraine's resources are the primary target. This supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, diplomatic failure, or fatigue specifically)."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly frames US support for Ukraine as a colonial project, portraying Ukraine not as a sovereign partner but as a future colony whose resources will be exploited by the West, specifically the US."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement delegitimizes the Ukrainian government by labeling it as both 'corrupt' and a 'neo-Nazi regime', directly attacking its integrity and political character."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is associated with nazism",
      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'neo-Nazi regime in Kiev' explicitly associates the Ukrainian government with Nazi ideology, a core element of this subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by reducing the Western motive for supporting Ukraine to pure resource extraction and geopolitical greed, which undermines Ukraine's agency and the legitimacy of its cause, but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives."

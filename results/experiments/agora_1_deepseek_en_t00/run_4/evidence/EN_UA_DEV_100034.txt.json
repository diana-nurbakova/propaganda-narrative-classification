      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions Russia's invasion as a cause, but also includes 'the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych' as a contributing factor to Ukraine's financial crisis. This fits the narrative of shifting some blame for negative outcomes (Ukraine's economic distress) away from the sole aggressor (Russia) and onto a Ukrainian actor."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "However, the $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs. At least $400 billion is needed to avoid loss.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the assessment and financial program supported by the International Monetary Fund (a key Western/international financial institution), suggesting its figures are inadequate and 'misleading'. This undermines the sufficiency and competence of Western-led financial support mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly predicts dire negative consequences for Western capitals (Amsterdam, Warsaw, Berlin, Prague) if Ukraine is not adequately supported, framing the conflict as a direct security threat to the West. This aligns with the narrative of highlighting adverse outcomes for Western countries."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lauds the 'free world' (a term commonly associated with Western democracies) by framing its support for Ukraine as a noble struggle against tyranny, attributing a morally superior and victorious role to it. This fits the definition of excessively praising the West's virtues and moral position."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The fewer public budget funds Ukraine needs to redeem and service its debt, the more it can invest in domestic weapons production and purchasing modern Western equipment. This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the conflict as one where Ukraine is defending the 'civilized world' (the West) from Russian invasion, implying that the West's support is not just aid but a necessary defense against a threat to themselves. It subtly shifts the narrative to suggest the West is involved because it is under threat, not solely because of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, aligning with the idea that the West's actions (supporting Ukraine) are driven by their own aggressive stance or self-preservation against Russia."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This statement attributes part of the cause for Ukraine's 2015 financial crisis to 'the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych,' alongside the Russian invasion. While acknowledging Russian aggression, it introduces an internal Ukrainian factor (Yanukovych's policies) as a contributing cause to the dire situation, which fits the parent narrative of blaming the war on others by partially shifting responsibility to a Ukrainian leader's actions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Some believe that since Ukraine receives large amounts of international aid, it can be used to settle with bondholders. However, over two-thirds of financial assistance arrives as loans to be redeemed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western financial assistance is not a selfless gift but a loan that burdens Ukraine, implying the West's primary interest is financial return rather than Ukraine's welfare."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "The call for the 'civilized world' to 'weaken the aggressor' implies that current Western actions (sanctions, asset freezes) are insufficient or not potent enough, framing the West as lacking in decisive power."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "According to the current International Monetary Fund-supported program (Q2, 2023 – Q1, 2027), Ukraine’s need for external financial assistance is estimated at $122 billion. However, over two years of the full-scale war, partners have already disbursed $100 billion annually. Therefore, the $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs. At least $400 billion is needed to avoid loss.",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes Western-led financial institutions (IMF) and partners for providing insufficient and misleading aid estimates, which supports the parent narrative by discrediting the adequacy and sincerity of Western diplomatic and financial support structures."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: The conflict will increase the Ukrainian refugee flows to Europe",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote catastrophizes the potential for the conflict to escalate and directly threaten Western European cities, implying severe negative consequences (destruction and civilian casualties) for the West if Ukraine is not financially supported to prevail."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by implying that Western actions (sanctions, asset confiscation) are necessary to avoid negative consequences (a stronger aggressor), but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows. It is a distinct argument about the financial cost and effort required from the West to prevent a worse outcome."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames the conflict as a moral battle where the 'free world' (a term synonymous with the West and its allies) is on the side of justice against 'dictators and tyrants', portraying Western support as morally superior and aligned with a just world order."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support",
      "evidence_quote": "The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine...",
      "reasoning": "This statement emphasizes the 'unity of the free world' and its 'unwavering long-term' support for Ukraine, portraying Western nations as broadly united and committed in their backing, which aligns with the subnarrative of widespread international support for Western-aligned actions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This passage overpraises the West by portraying it as the 'civilized world' that needs protection from Russian barbarism, and frames Western support for Ukraine as a defensive shield for Western cities themselves. This supports the parent narrative of overpraising the West but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about NATO destroying Russia, moral superiority, or international support."

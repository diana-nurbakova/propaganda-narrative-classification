      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the stage... three climate change radicals stormed the stage.",
      "reasoning": "The terms 'radical climate activist' and 'climate change radicals' are used to describe the protesters, framing the climate movement as extreme and disruptive, which aligns with the narrative of criticizing the movement's motives, integrity, or impact."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears",
      "evidence_quote": "The activist group Restore Wetlands claimed responsibility for the act, saying: 'Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.'",
      "reasoning": "The quoted statement from the activist group explicitly warns of 'climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences,' which directly serves to emphasize and amplify fears about the consequences of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Watch: Eco-Loon Decked by Camera Crane After Storming Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The term 'Eco-Loon' is a derogatory and dismissive label attacking the character and sanity of the activists, fitting the definition of ad hominem attacks on key activists."

      "evidence_quote": "The three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the activists' actions as criminal (vandalism) and disruptive, which criticizes the climate movement's methods but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or solely 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "This quote from the activist group presents a catastrophic, large-scale scenario of societal collapse as a direct result of climate change, which aligns with the definition of presenting intense catastrophic scenarios as results of climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition?",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by justifying disruptive activism based on climate fears, but it does not fit neatly into the specific definitions of 'Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'Doomsday scenarios for humans', or 'Whatever we do it is already too late'. It is a distinct argument that uses climate concern to rationalize extreme action."

      "evidence_quote": "\"That's what's boiling the oceans, creating these atmospheric rivers, and the rain bombs, and sucking the moisture out of the land and creating the droughts, and melting the ice and raising the sea level, and causing these waves of climate refugees, predicted to reach one billion in this century.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quoted statement from Al Gore, presented in the text, lists a cascade of catastrophic consequences (boiling oceans, droughts, sea level rise, a billion refugees) which serves as a primary example of amplifying fears about climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "The legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for \"renewable energy,\" meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes a major climate policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) by questioning its economic allocation and predicting a negative outcome ('a very dark and cold future'), thereby challenging its effectiveness and impact."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Renewable energy ... is now the cheapest source of electricity in almost the entire planet,\" Gore lied.",

      "reasoning": "This commenter's statement minimizes the significance of climate change by asserting that past predictions have consistently failed, thereby suggesting the current concerns are unfounded and exaggerated."

      "reasoning": "This quote raises doubts about the scientific consensus and predictions related to climate change by citing an alleged track record of failure, directly questioning the reliability of the science and its measurements."

      "reasoning": "This quote attacks Al Gore's personal credibility and lifestyle, suggesting hypocrisy by highlighting his high personal fossil fuel consumption, which is a direct ad hominem attack on a key climate activist figure."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement's proposed solutions (renewable energy legislation) by portraying them as leading to a negative outcome ('a very dark and cold future'). It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks' provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote presents an intense, catastrophic scenario involving extreme weather, sea-level rise, and a massive displacement of one billion people, directly matching the definition of presenting doomsday scenarios for humans as a result of climate change."

      "reasoning": "The text uses exaggerated and alarming language like 'boiling the oceans' and 'rain bombs' to describe climate effects, speculating on severe side effects to spread panic, which aligns with amplifying existing fears of global warming."

      "reasoning": "This quote, while presented as a critique, references and amplifies a litany of past catastrophic climate predictions (e.g., mass extinction, famine, flooding) within the article's framing, supporting the parent narrative of amplifying climate fears through a historical catalog of alarmist claims. It does not fit the other specific subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames climate policy (the Inflation Reduction Act) as a massive financial appropriation that will fund specific industries (windmills, solar panels), implying the policy is driven by corporate or financial interests ('appropriation funds') rather than genuine environmental benefit, which aligns with the 'only for profit' subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote, from a commenter included in the text, directly argues that the predictions and scenarios used to justify climate policies have consistently failed to materialize, suggesting the underlying rationale and thus the policies themselves are ineffective."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames renewable energy investment as a massive, wasteful expenditure that will lead to a negative outcome ('dark and cold future'), aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive and not worth adopting."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Renewable energy ... is now the cheapest source of electricity in almost the entire planet,\" Gore lied.",
      "reasoning": "By labeling Gore's statement about renewable energy being cheap as a lie, the text implicitly argues against its economic viability and, by extension, its reliability as a dependable energy source for widespread use."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "in exchange for globalist \"green\" energy.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase frames the push for renewable energy as part of a 'globalist' agenda, which is a distinct argument supporting the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies but does not fit the definitions of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly supports the parent narrative by dismissing climate change concerns as failed alarmist predictions, but it does not align with any of the specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it does not argue that cycles are natural, that weather suggests cooling, that impacts are insignificant, etc.). It is a general dismissal of climate change predictions."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Green activities are a form of neo-colonialism",
      "evidence_quote": "The legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for \"renewable energy,\" meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the U.S. climate legislation (the Inflation Reduction Act) as a coercive financial instrument that imposes a specific energy future ('dark and cold') on humanity, suggesting developed nations are using green initiatives to exert control and dictate terms, which aligns with the neo-colonialism subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes climate policy as being economically abusive and exploitative, specifically targeting poor people by suggesting they must give up affordable energy while elites (like Gore) are exempt, fitting the definition of exploitative international relations."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "though L.A.’s infrastructure is not widely considered “high-quality.” A proposed high-speed rail between L.A. and San Francisco has been largely canceled, and current passenger rail service from L.A. to San Diego has been suspended because of a potential landslide hazard.",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the competence and credibility of the local government (led by Mayor Garcetti) and its transportation initiatives, undermining the authority's claims about 'high-quality urban transportation infrastructure' by pointing to specific failures."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific climate policy (the Green New Deal) by highlighting its political opposition and electoral failure, suggesting it is not achieving its intended goals."

      "evidence_quote": "It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "This statement, following the calculation of the carbon cost of Garcetti's flight, implies the trip was unnecessary and questions the genuine environmental motive behind the in-person summit, hinting at other potential drivers like prestige or spending."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Mayor Eric Garcetti's performance and legacy, focusing on domestic failures (crime, homelessness) and a political crisis within his party, thereby discrediting him as a political figure in the context of his climate-focused activities."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, implying that climate policies mandating such a shift are impractical and could harm energy security and developing nations."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF. The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the shift in bank investments as a response to pressure from activist groups and alliances like the UN's Net Zero Banking Alliance, suggesting environmental policies are tools used to influence and control major financial institutions' behavior, aligning with the narrative that green policies serve as instruments of power and influence."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline uses the phrase 'Bend The Knee,' which frames the banks' actions as a submissive capitulation to the demands of climate activists, thereby challenging the legitimacy and impact of the climate movement by portraying it as a coercive force."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios... New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This passage depicts financial institutions and public officials (like the NYC Comptroller) as being pressured or coerced by activist agendas, casting doubt on their autonomy and suggesting their climate-related decisions are driven by external pressure rather than sound judgment or genuine concern."

      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing a report from BloombergNEF. The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the banks' climate-related actions primarily as financial investment decisions ('investing $0.81... for every $1'), suggesting the shift is driven by profit-seeking in a growing 'green energy' market rather than purely by environmental concern, aligning with the subnarrative that climate policies are profit-driven."

      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline's phrasing 'Bend The Knee To Climate Activists' frames the banks' policy changes as a submission to activist pressure rather than a rational or independent policy choice, which is a criticism of climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of economic harm, ineffectiveness, or profit motive."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the global push for green energy as potentially exploitative, highlighting how developing nations lack the resources and infrastructure to comply with the rapid shift demanded by international climate alliances and policies, which could place an unfair economic burden on them."

      "evidence_quote": "“Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act,” said Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, in a press release. “On the one hand, investing in energy security is essential – the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "The statement implies that the transition to renewables, driven by international alliances like the Net Zero Banking Alliance, is a policy imposed by developed nations and financial institutions that developing countries are ill-equipped to adopt, suggesting a form of economic and developmental control reminiscent of colonial practices."

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This passage depicts green policies as instruments of geopolitical and financial pressure, where activist investors and public officials use financial leverage (threatening to pull pension funds) to enforce climate agendas on major banks, framing environmental goals as tools for exerting control within the global financial system."

      "reasoning": "This quote, by highlighting the financial investment ratio, frames the climate movement's influence on banks as driven by financial interests and market pressures rather than purely environmental concerns, suggesting ulterior motives or a corrupting influence of capital."

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This frames climate activists (specifically 'activist investors' and public officials like Brad Lander) as using coercive financial threats and pressure tactics, attacking their methods and portraying them as aggressive forces compelling banks to act against their business judgment."

      "evidence_quote": "Link to Major Banks Bend The Knee To Climate Activists, Accelerate Plans To Cut Coal Investments",
      "reasoning": "The headline's phrase 'Bend The Knee' frames the banks' actions as a submission to the demands of climate activists, portraying the climate movement as a powerful, domineering force that compels obedience, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "evidence_quote": "Both banks are founding members of the United Nations’ Net Zero Banking Alliance, which requires its 126 members to set goals and disclose financial data related to their efforts to reduce the emissions of their lending portfolio to net zero by 2050.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the banks' actions as a response to requirements from the United Nations' Net Zero Banking Alliance, implicitly presenting the UN as an international entity exerting influence and setting binding rules on financial institutions, which aligns with criticism of the role of international entities."

      "evidence_quote": "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a specific political figure (Brad Lander) using his official position and public funds to pressure banks, portraying political actors as actively driving the climate agenda through financial coercion, which fits the definition of discrediting political figures in the climate debate."

      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks — all named above — submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "This describes a regulatory action by a major U.S. financial authority (the Federal Reserve) mandating climate-related disclosures from banks. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities by showing a governmental body imposing climate-focused requirements on the financial sector, but it does not fit neatly into the specific subcategories of 'EU', 'international entities', 'national governments', or 'political organizations/figures' as defined."

      "evidence_quote": "In their turn, Ukrainian forces attempted to reach Russian territory with UAVs. Overnight, two Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the Bryansk region, three more over the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea, the Russian Defense Ministry said.",
      "reasoning": "The framing presents Ukrainian actions as ineffective (drones were 'destroyed') and as the initiators of attacks on 'Russian territory', including Crimea (a contested annexation), which serves to discredit Ukrainian military efforts and portray them as aggressors against Russian-held areas."

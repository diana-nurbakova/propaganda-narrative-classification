      "evidence_quote": "After multiple instances of vandalism against famous landmarks and artistic works of western cultural significance, many people are growing annoyed with the actions of climate alarmists.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly criticizes the actions and methods of climate activists, framing them as 'alarmists' whose vandalism is causing public annoyance, which aligns with the narrative of challenging the motives, integrity, or impact of the climate movement."

      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly criticizes the climate movement's public relations strategy, suggesting its actions are counterproductive and damaging to its own cause, which fits the definition of challenging the movement's impact and motives."

      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical '(it's not)' directly dismisses the legitimacy of man-made climate change as a threat, which is a clear statement minimizing the significance of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase suggests that predictions related to global warming (a core aspect of climate change) are exaggerated and fail to come true, thereby downplaying the reality and impact of climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "Despite billions of dollars spent yearly by governments and NGOs on climate propaganda, blind belief in climate hysteria is on the decline.",

      "evidence_quote": "Less than half of Americans believe climate change is caused by human activity.",
      "reasoning": "By citing polling data on public belief, the text implicitly raises doubt about the scientific consensus that climate change is primarily caused by human activity, suggesting the science is not settled or widely accepted."

      "evidence_quote": "climate activists seem to be more concerned with media coverage than making sense",
      "reasoning": "This suggests the activists' primary motive is not the cause itself but generating attention, implying ulterior or unethical motives, which fits the 'corrupt' subnarrative definition of being influenced by ulterior motives."

      "evidence_quote": "this is the worst PR the movement could receive",
      "reasoning": "This criticizes the movement's tactics and effectiveness, supporting the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement, but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of alarmism, corruption, or ad hominem attacks on specific key figures."

      "evidence_quote": "Their defacement of Stonehenge could be considered relatively successful because no one was able to stop them. It's impossible to understand the logic behind the focus on an ancient site created thousands of year before the development of carbon based energy. However, climate activists seem to be more concerned with media coverage than making sense.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the climate movement's tactics as illogical, counterproductive, and primarily driven by a desire for media attention rather than genuine environmental concern. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks' as defined."

      "evidence_quote": "For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not)",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly rejects the core scientific consensus that human activity is causing climate change, supporting the parent narrative of questioning the science. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about methodologies, data, or the scientific community's reliability, as it is a broad dismissal of the foundational premise."

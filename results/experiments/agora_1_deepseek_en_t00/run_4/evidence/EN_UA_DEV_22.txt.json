      "reasoning": "The statement criticizes Western (European) policy as being a destructive 'proxy war' driven by American interests, which discredits the motives and actions of Western diplomacy."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the continuation of the war away from Russia and onto the West, accusing Western powers of blocking a peace deal and thereby prolonging the conflict."

      "evidence_quote": "“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,”",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames the war as an American proxy conflict, with the West (specifically the EU) as the aggressor intentionally fueling the war to harm Russia, rather than Russia being the invading party."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West for the war's violence ('supporting the killing of Slavs') and framing Western support as the cause of a potential broader Slavic retaliation, but it does not fit neatly into the 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' definitions as it introduces a distinct ethno-nationalist threat narrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the EU as a divided entity, showing internal conflict and lack of unity on a key policy issue (support for Ukraine), which aligns with the definition of presenting the EU as a set of divided entities and interests."

      "reasoning": "This quote discredits past diplomatic efforts (a peace agreement) by blaming the West for vetoing it, implying that diplomacy was sabotaged and, by extension, that current or future diplomatic efforts are undermined or futile."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by framing the conflict as a cynical American 'proxy war' pursued to damage Russia, which is a distinct argument not covered by the other specific subnarratives. It portrays Western motives as aggressive and destructive rather than weak, divided, or disinterested."

      "evidence_quote": "\"We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western support has negative consequences (wasting taxpayer money, pursuing interests that are not served, and contributing to Ukraine's destruction), but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a catastrophic escalation, warning that continued Western support for Ukraine will provoke a unified Slavic (implied Russian-led) retaliation that will destroy Western Europe, aligning with the subnarrative of warning against actions that upset Russia and risk a wider world war."

      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,”",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by amplifying fears related to the war's continuation, specifically by claiming the West deliberately prolonged the conflict by blocking peace. It fosters anxiety about the war's avoidable nature and the consequences of continued involvement, but does not fit the specific definitions of nuclear use, NATO intervention, or Russia attacking other countries."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames the war as an 'American proxy war,' directly supporting the subnarrative that Ukraine is not an independent actor but a tool used by Western powers (specifically the US) to achieve geopolitical goals against Russia."

      "evidence_quote": "“We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs... He noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a “US problem.””",
      "reasoning": "The statement that the EU has 'no chance of winning against Russia' and the characterization of the conflict as a futile 'US problem' portray the situation as having no viable positive outcome for Ukraine, aligning with the 'hopeless' subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "“Now it is openly acknowledged that this war could have been stopped in the first months if the West had not vetoed the peace agreement in April,” said Irish MEP Clare Daly. “And you have the audacity to claim that this is assistance to Ukraine. The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by arguing that Western support is not genuine assistance but rather a cynical ploy for profit that has prolonged the war. This specific argument—that aid is driven by arms industry profits and has prevented peace—does not fit neatly into the other provided subnarrative definitions."

      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto Western nations (the UK and US), framing them as the actors who prevented a peaceful settlement."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine. As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "This passage undermines Ukraine's military and governmental effectiveness by highlighting desperate conscription measures, a shortage of soldiers, and an aging fighting force, painting a picture of a failing state."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Western (and Ukrainian) policy as reckless and counterproductive, directly discrediting their diplomatic and military strategy as pointless and escalatory."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This language evokes fear by suggesting that current Western-supported actions are moving the world toward a catastrophic nuclear event, amplifying anxieties about the conflict's potential global consequences."

      "evidence_quote": "But rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the prolongation of the war on Ukraine and its Western backers for their escalatory actions, rather than on Russia's initial invasion and continued aggression. It is a distinct argument not captured by the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors' subnarratives, as it focuses on current escalation rather than initial cause."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military",
      "evidence_quote": "Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly undermines the capabilities and effectiveness of the Ukrainian armed forces by highlighting the failure of a major military operation and net territorial loss."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers that no amount of foreign aid or equipment transfers can do anything to alleviate... leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This portrays the Ukrainian government as incompetent and resorting to desperate, potentially unpopular measures to address a critical manpower crisis, thereby delegitimizing its policies and leadership."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv... But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly frames Ukraine's military situation as unsustainable and without a viable path to victory, portraying the future as bleak and hopeless."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by portraying its government and its Western allies as reckless and irresponsible, escalating the conflict pointlessly. This argument does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that Western powers (UK and US) sabotaged a potential peace deal for Ukraine, prioritizing their own strategic interests (presumably weakening Russia) over ending the war and saving Ukrainian lives."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames current Western policy as a fantasy of military victory, implicitly dismissing its feasibility, and presents diplomatic negotiation ('words') as the only realistic alternative, suggesting current diplomatic efforts are absent or ineffective."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But the West’s chosen depiction of Putin as a tyrant bent on conquering the entire European continent suffered its latest setback last month when it came out that the Russian president is interested in halting the fighting and negotiating a deal that recognizes the current battlefield lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by directly challenging and discrediting the West's official characterization of Putin and its stated rationale for the war, arguing the West's narrative is false because Russia is allegedly open to peace. This specific argument—that the West's core narrative about the enemy's motives is a fabrication—does not fit neatly into the other provided subnarrative definitions."

      "reasoning": "The quote directly warns against pursuing a major offensive against Russia, framing it as a dangerous fantasy that could lead to a catastrophic escalation, implicitly evoking the fear of a world war if the conflict is not resolved diplomatically."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden then renewed one of his favorite tropes, asserting that if Ukraine falls, its people will be subjugated, its neighbors will be in immediate danger, and all of Europe will be threatened by Putin’s aggressive ambitions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears by describing a domino effect of danger and subjugation across Europe if Ukraine falls. It evokes fear of broader conflict but does not precisely match the definitions of Russia attacking other countries, WWIII, nuclear use, or NATO intervention as defined."

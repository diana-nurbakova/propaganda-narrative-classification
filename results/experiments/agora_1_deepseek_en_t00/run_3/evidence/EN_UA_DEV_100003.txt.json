      "reasoning": "The quote is a direct prediction about the potential future capture of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, by Russian forces, which fits the definition of speculating about war outcomes."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly suggests a decline in Ukrainian military effectiveness and strength by stating they are at a severe material disadvantage and facing a critical shortage of external support, which supports the subnarrative of the Ukrainian army collapsing."

      "reasoning": "This quote speculates on a future war outcome (the capture of Kyiv) but does not fit the specific definitions of 'Russian army is collapsing', 'Russian army will lose all occupied territories', or 'Ukrainian army is collapsing'. It is a speculative prediction of a Russian military advance, which is a core theme of the parent narrative 'Speculating war outcomes'."

      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Ukraine as being in a dire military situation with no immediate prospect for improvement due to being outmatched and lacking critical Western support, aligning with the definition of portraying Ukraine as having no viable positive future."

Putin said Tuesday that Russian troops would push further into Ukraine to build on their success on the battlefield after the weekend fall of the town of Avdiivka where he said Ukrainian troops had been forced to flee in chaos.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights Russian military success (the fall of Avdiivka) and projects future advances, positively emphasizing the scale and momentum of Russia's military operations."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Russia's territorial claims as legitimate and historically justified, and framing the annexation of Ukrainian territory as a 'homecoming'. This is a form of praise for Russia's actions and identity, but it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarrative definitions provided."

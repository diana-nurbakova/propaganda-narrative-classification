      "narrative_name": "CC: Climate change is beneficial",
      "evidence_quote": "CO2 is the GREENING molecule: New study shows how elevated CO2 levels increase vegetation growth and WATER AVAILABILITY in the Northern Hemisphere",
      "reasoning": "The headline and article frame elevated CO2 levels as a direct, positive cause of increased vegetation growth and improved water availability, presenting climate change (via CO2 increase) as beneficial."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The very compound that the Democrats are targeting – CO2 – is actually the solution to preserving croplands, grasslands, forests and water supplies for growing populations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes climate policies (specifically those targeting CO2 reduction) by arguing they are misguided and that the targeted substance is, in fact, beneficial."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Of course, as wildfires and droughts increase, Democrats will continue to deride “climate change” as the greatest threat and continue to guilt the world into paying more to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the motives and actions of a political authority (Democrats), accusing them of using fear and guilt to push for costly carbon removal policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s a spiral of death and destruction, coming from a death cult pretending to be the planet’s savior.",
      "reasoning": "This statement uses extreme, pejorative language ('death cult') to challenge the integrity and motives of those advocating for climate action, characterizing the movement as destructive and deceitful."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Climate change is beneficial: CO2 is beneficial",
      "evidence_quote": "Elevated CO2 levels enhance vegetation growth through the so-called \"fertilization effect\" and improve water use efficiency. This indirect effect boosts water availability by reducing overall water consumption per unit of biomass.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that increased CO2 levels have positive impacts on vegetation growth and water efficiency, which aligns with the definition of the 'CO2 is beneficial' subnarrative."

      "evidence_quote": "The very compound that the Democrats are targeting – CO2 – is actually the solution to preserving croplands, grasslands, forests and water supplies for growing populations.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames CO2 as a 'solution' for preserving ecosystems and resources for humanity, which supports the parent narrative that climate change is beneficial but does not fit neatly into the specific 'CO2 is beneficial' or 'Temperature increase is beneficial' definitions, as it makes a broader, more political claim about CO2's role."

      "evidence_quote": "The sequestration of carbon dioxide is a grave mistake that will slowly harm important ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a core climate policy (carbon sequestration) by claiming it will cause harm, implying the policy fails to achieve its intended environmental goal and is counterproductive."

      "evidence_quote": "Democrats will continue to deride 'climate change' as the greatest threat and continue to guilt the world into paying more to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames climate action as a financial scheme, suggesting the motivation is to extract payments ('guilt the world into paying more') rather than address genuine environmental concerns."

      "evidence_quote": "The very compound that the Democrats are targeting – CO2 – is actually the solution to preserving croplands, grasslands, forests and water supplies for growing populations.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by criticizing the foundational premise of climate policies (targeting CO2), claiming CO2 is beneficial. It does not fit the specific definitions of 'ineffective', 'negative economic impact', or 'only for profit', as it challenges the scientific rationale itself."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes a specific political organization (the Democratic Party) by framing their policy target (CO2 reduction) as misguided and contrary to scientific evidence, which fits the definition of discrediting political organizations in the climate debate."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the Democratic Party's characterization of climate change and their proposed financial solutions, portraying their actions as disingenuous and exploitative, which aligns with discrediting political figures and organizations."

      "reasoning": "This hyperbolic statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities by condemning the broader climate action movement or its proponents as a destructive 'death cult'. It expresses disapproval but does not fit neatly into the specific subcategories of criticizing the EU, international entities, national governments, or a named political organization/figure."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames the climate movement (represented by 'Democrats') as exaggerating the threat of climate change ('the greatest threat') and using guilt to drive policy, which aligns with the definition of portraying the movement as alarmist."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement's core policy target (reducing CO2) by arguing it is misguided and harmful, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit neatly into the more specific 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem' subnarratives."

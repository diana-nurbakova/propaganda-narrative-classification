      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine? Well, just blame China.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts blame for the war in Ukraine away from Russia, instead attributing responsibility to the West for a 'proxy war' and suggesting China is being falsely accused as an 'enabler'."

      "evidence_quote": "A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes and delegitimizes NATO, portraying it not as a defensive alliance but as an aggressive tool of American expansionism, which aligns with discrediting Western diplomatic and security structures."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This highlights a negative outcome (depleting weapons stocks without victory) for Western countries due to their involvement in Ukraine, fitting the narrative of predicting or reporting adverse consequences for the West."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This statement undermines the credibility of Western mainstream media and official narratives, suggesting their information is not believed by the global public, which fosters distrust towards these media sources."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly evokes fear by stating that America is 'globalising the war' and starting a 'third world war', which is a direct amplification of severe, existential war-related fears."

      "evidence_quote": "It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement devalues Ukrainian lives and discredits the Ukrainian government's actions by portraying it as forcibly conscripting men as 'cannon fodder', undermining Ukraine's legitimacy and methods."

So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly shifts responsibility for the war's continuation and escalation onto the West, framing it as a 'proxy war' they are waging and failing at, while also accusing them of falsely blaming China. This matches the definition of blaming the West for the conflict."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West for prolonging and expanding the war, but it also introduces a distinct element of blaming Ukraine itself ('Kyiv has been dragging men...') for its conduct, which does not fit the specific 'Ukraine is the aggressor' subnarrative (which implies Ukraine started the war). This is a separate argument that supports the overarching narrative of blaming others, thus qualifies as 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly states that the West is willing to prolong the war in Ukraine for its own strategic benefit (expanding to Asia), showing a callous disregard for Ukrainian lives, which are treated as expendable ('just Ukrainian lives after all')."

      "reasoning": "This statement presents the West as militarily ineffective and depleted ('emptying their own weapons warehouses') despite massive investment, and unable to achieve victory ('still not winning'), which aligns with the definition of portraying the West as non-potent."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying NATO not as a legitimate defensive alliance but as an aggressive, expansionist tool. This argument does not fit neatly into any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided (e.g., it's not about division, weakness, overreaction, etc.), but it clearly aims to discredit the West's diplomatic and military institutions."

      "evidence_quote": "So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western military support for Ukraine is depleting their own arsenals ('emptying their own weapons warehouses') and is failing to achieve victory ('still not winning'), which catastrophizes the negative, self-harming effects of Western intervention."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that Western/American actions are leading to catastrophic global consequences—specifically, the expansion of conflict and the risk of a third world war. This is a negative consequence for the West and the world, but it does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda",
      "evidence_quote": "No wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly accuses Western mainstream newsrooms of being part of a 'dis-information war' and implies they propagate 'nonsense' that is only believed within their own circles, framing them as instruments of propaganda for Western power corridors."

      "evidence_quote": "Given his obvious mental decline, US President Joe Biden may be forgiven for claiming to ABC News’ host George Stephanopoulos that he was indispensable: “You know, not only am I campaigning, but I’m running the world.”",
      "reasoning": "This statement discredits a specific Western media interview (ABC News) by framing the President's claim as a symptom of 'mental decline', thereby casting doubt on the credibility and seriousness of the media platform hosting and reporting on such statements, which supports the broader narrative of distrust towards media."

      "evidence_quote": "America may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly evokes fear of a third world war, framing the conflict's expansion as a deliberate act of globalizing war, which aligns with the subnarrative of warning against actions that risk WW3."

      "evidence_quote": "But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition, then expand it to Asia.",
      "reasoning": "The statement explicitly claims that the war will be expanded from Eastern Europe to Asia, implying an imminent threat of conflict spreading to other countries, which matches the subnarrative definition."

      "evidence_quote": "Alarmingly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Nato as playing a “bridge” between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific theatres.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests NATO is positioning itself to take a direct, expanded role by bridging conflicts in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, implying a shift towards direct intervention in a broader theater."

      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by accusing the West of scapegoating China to justify and prolong the conflict, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting the specific definitions of the other subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly delegitimizes the Ukrainian government's mobilization policies, portraying them as desperate, inhumane, and treating citizens as expendable, which fits the definition of discrediting the government and its actions."

      "evidence_quote": "Messed up your proxy war in Ukraine?... the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict...",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'proxy war' frames the conflict in Ukraine as a war orchestrated and fueled by the West, with Ukraine acting as its instrument, which aligns with the narrative that Ukraine is controlled by Western powers."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "But if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition... It’s just Ukrainian lives after all;",
      "reasoning": "This statement portrays the conflict as a protracted, unwinnable war of attrition where Ukrainian lives are being sacrificed for a futile cause, emphasizing a sense of hopelessness and lack of positive future for Ukraine."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock",
      "reasoning": "The quote attributes Germany's energy crisis and economic hardship to the 'sanctions regime imposed... by the United States and the West' and the 'sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines,' framing these as primary causes alongside the war itself. This shifts blame for negative consequences away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and onto Western policy responses."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet... Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly highlights severe adverse economic outcomes for Germany and other European nations as a direct result of the disruption of Russian gas supplies, which is linked to the sanctions regime. It frames the West's actions as causing self-inflicted harm."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity... But all of this was forsaken in the quixotic pursuit of a utopian vision of zero-carbon green energy.",
      "reasoning": "The text heavily criticizes Western (specifically German) energy and climate policies as 'misguided,' 'near-sighted,' 'self-sabotaging,' and 'quixotic,' portraying them as incompetent and ideologically driven failures that have damaged the national economy."

    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "This narrative is not present in the text. The text is highly critical of Western (German) policies and does not contain excessive or undue praise for Western virtues, accomplishments, or moral superiority.",

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly identifies the Western sanctions regime as a primary cause of Germany's energy crisis, shifting the responsibility for the negative economic consequences away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and onto the actions of the United States and the West."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What President Donald Trump was referring to in 2018 was Germany’s increasing dependence on Russian gas, which in turn resulted from “green” energy policies implemented over the previous decade. These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity...",
      "reasoning": "This argument blames Germany's vulnerability (which the war then exploited) on its own 'green fanaticism' and domestic political decisions, framing the war's impact as a consequence of prior Western policy failures rather than Russian aggression. It supports the parent narrative by attributing the cause of the crisis to actors other than the invader."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes Germany's energy crisis and high costs to the Western sanctions regime against Russia, framing the sanctions as a self-inflicted wound that forces Germany into an emergency situation."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This passage details the negative economic consequences (high electricity prices, worse inflation) for Germany and other European nations as a direct result of the disruption of Russian gas supplies, which is linked to the conflict and sanctions. It supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West but does not fit the specific 'refugee flows' subnarrative, making it a remainder."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided",
      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights a division within Europe, specifically between nations that were heavily reliant on Russian gas and those that were not, suggesting the EU is not a unified bloc but a set of entities with differing interests and vulnerabilities."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This statement presents a core Western European power, Germany, as economically crippled and failing due to its own policies, which implicitly portrays the West as non-potent and in decline."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West... Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock...",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the Western sanctions regime as the direct cause of Germany's severe energy crisis and economic hardship, implying the West's reaction (sanctions) has been disproportionate and self-destructive."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s beleaguered citizens appear to have had enough of this disaster... One of the party’s main selling points is that it’s “an aggressive opponent of the government’s energy and climate policy.”",
      "reasoning": "The entire article frames Germany's support for Western policies (green agenda, sanctions) as a catastrophic sacrifice of its own national interests and citizen welfare. The rise of an opposition party based on opposing these policies suggests the West's actions are not about Ukraine's benefit, but about imposing costly, ideologically-driven agendas on its own members."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West by portraying its core policies (the green energy transition) as foolish, self-destructive, and ideologically driven utopianism that has weakened a major Western power. This specific argument about the folly of the green agenda does not fit neatly into the other, more diplomacy-focused subnarratives but is a key part of discrediting Western leadership and decision-making."

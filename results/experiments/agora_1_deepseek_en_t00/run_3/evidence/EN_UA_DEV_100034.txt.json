      "narrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions Russia's invasion as a cause, but also introduces 'the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych' as a contributing factor to Ukraine's financial crisis. This partially shifts the narrative of blame for Ukraine's dire situation onto a past Ukrainian leader, alongside the invader."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lauds the 'free world' (a term commonly associated with Western democracies) as the collective force for good against 'dictators and tyrants,' framing the conflict in stark moral terms that extol the virtues and moral superiority of the Western bloc."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear by predicting a direct, catastrophic threat to Western civilian infrastructure and populations (children's hospitals, maternity wards) in major European capitals, suggesting the war will inevitably spread to the West if Ukraine does not prevail."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Democracy and a just world order are the pillars of global economic sustainability, ensuring investment safety and security and investor profits worldwide.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that if Ukraine does not win (and democracy/the just world order is not upheld), there will be negative global economic consequences, specifically threatening 'investment safety and security and investor profits worldwide,' which directly impacts Western financial interests."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors",
      "evidence_quote": "The fewer public budget funds Ukraine needs to redeem and service its debt, the more it can invest in domestic weapons production and purchasing modern Western equipment. This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the conflict as one where Ukraine is defending the 'civilized world' (the West) from Russian invasion, implying that the West's support is not just aid but a necessary defense against a threat to themselves. It subtly shifts the narrative to suggest the West is involved because it is under threat, not solely because of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, aligning with the idea that the West's actions (supporting Ukraine) are driven by their own aggression/defensive needs."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "This statement attributes part of the cause for Ukraine's 2015 economic crisis to 'the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.' While it acknowledges Russia's invasion, it also blames a Ukrainian leader's policies for exacerbating the situation, which fits the parent narrative of blaming others (in this case, a past Ukrainian government) for problems related to the war context, even if not directly for the war's initiation."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames the conflict as a moral battle where the 'free world' (a term synonymous with the West) is on the side of justice against 'dictators and tyrants', portraying Western support as morally superior and aligned with a just cause."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support",
      "evidence_quote": "The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine...",
      "reasoning": "This statement emphasizes the 'unity of the free world' and its 'unwavering' support for Ukraine, presenting Western nations as a cohesive bloc providing essential backing, which aligns with the subnarrative of widespread international support for Western-aligned actions."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This passage overpraises the West by portraying it as the 'civilized world' that needs protection, implicitly contrasting it with Russian aggression, and framing Western cities (Amsterdam, Warsaw, Berlin, Prague) as symbols of civilization under threat. This supports the parent narrative of overpraising the West but does not fit the specific definitions of the other subnarratives."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly warns that if Ukraine is not financially supported to resist Russia, the threat of Russian military attacks will extend to other European capitals, directly supporting the subnarrative that Russia will attack other countries."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: The conflict will increase the Ukrainian refugee flows to Europe",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote catastrophizes the potential for the conflict to escalate and directly threaten Western European cities, implying severe negative consequences (destruction, civilian casualties) for the West if Ukraine does not receive sufficient support to prevail."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by implying that Western actions (sanctions, asset confiscation) are necessary to avoid negative consequences (i.e., not weakening the aggressor would lead to worse outcomes for the West). It is a distinct argument not covered by the more specific subnarratives."

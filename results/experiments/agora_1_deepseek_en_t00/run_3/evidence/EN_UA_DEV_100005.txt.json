      "evidence_quote": "Will they resort to nuclear weapons to even out the war?",
      "reasoning": "This question, posed in the introductory text, evokes fear and anxiety about the potential for nuclear escalation, which is a core element of amplifying war-related fears."

      "evidence_quote": "Scott Ritter ..good topics ..talking the truth..",
      "reasoning": "In the context of the interview where Ritter is presented as explaining 'what is really going on' and countering Western media, praising him as 'talking the truth' implicitly praises the Russian perspective he is associated with presenting."

      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death. The question is, why the desperation to keep the war going?",
      "reasoning": "This implies that the West, through its media, is deliberately prolonging the war in Ukraine for its own reasons (e.g., to weaken Russia), showing a disregard for Ukrainian lives and prioritizing Western strategic interests."

      "evidence_quote": "amerikans are the greatest pigs on the planet…and that is in the most derogitive term you can imagine.. absolute pigs",
      "reasoning": "This is a broad, vitriolic attack on the moral character of Americans (representing the West) that supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West but does not fit any of the more specific diplomatic subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames Western (specifically American) actions and rhetoric towards Russia as exaggerated and provocative, implying that this approach is misguided and will lead to negative consequences, aligning with the idea that Western policies (like sanctions or confrontation) are counterproductive and backfire."

      "evidence_quote": "lets get on with a full nuke war…wipe us all out …at least it (for most) will be over quickly and no more of month after month of promises from Trump or threats from the east….POOF..it’s all over …thanks mostly to un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries” they are proving the worst of the worst of humanity",
      "reasoning": "This quote catastrophizes the potential outcome of the conflict, suggesting a nuclear war that would wipe out populations, and explicitly blames 'un-elected bureaucrats in all “western countries”' for leading to this apocalyptic scenario. It supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West but does not fit the specific definitions of sanctions backfiring or refugee flows; it instead presents a broader, existential negative consequence."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by arguing that current Western actions (media framing) are prolonging the war, which implicitly amplifies war-related fears by suggesting more death is inevitable due to this prolongation. It does not fit any of the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by accusing Western media of a specific, harmful misrepresentation (framing Russia as losing) that has real-world consequences (prolonging war and death). It discredits Western media but does not fit the more specific definitions of being an 'instrument of propaganda' or targeting Ukrainian media; it is a distinct argument about misleading framing."

Sadly the western media is framing the war as if Russia is losing which only prolongs negotiations and causes more death.",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the Western media's portrayal of Russian losses as a harmful falsehood that prolongs conflict, implying that an accurate understanding (presumably that Russia is winning) would lead to quicker peace, thus portraying Russia's position as one that could bring about a negotiated end to death and suffering."

      "reasoning": "This statement directly praises Russia by countering the Western 'boogie man' narrative, arguing that Russia has been historically and unjustly portrayed as a threat when it was 'SELDOM a threat'. This supports the parent narrative of praising Russia by presenting it as a misunderstood and unfairly maligned nation."

      "evidence_quote": "time to stop caring about the people that do not care..they are the enemy of one sort or the other.. time they took responsibility (rather than consequences) of what their politicians are doing in their name",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the war on Western populations for allowing their politicians to act, but it does not fit the specific definitions of Ukraine or the West as the sole aggressor; it's a broader blame assignment."

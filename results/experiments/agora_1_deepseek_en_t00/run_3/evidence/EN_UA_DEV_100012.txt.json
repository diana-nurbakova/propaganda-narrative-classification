      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "The text frames the US motivation for supporting Ukraine as a resource grab, implying the West's material interests, not Russia's invasion, are the primary driver of the conflict. This shifts blame for the war's continuation away from Russia."

      "evidence_quote": "Graham is treating Ukraine as a future colony of the US with his comments on the ownership of the country's natural resources... 'The fate of the colonies is always the same: the Americans will scoop up all the natural resources of Ukraine in exchange for 'the great honor of being a friend of the United States''",
      "reasoning": "The text, through the Russian official's statement, directly criticizes and discredits Western (specifically US) intentions, portraying them as colonialist and exploitative rather than supportive."

      "evidence_quote": "\"Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the legitimacy and character of the Ukrainian government, labeling it as both 'corrupt' and a 'neo-Nazi regime', which aligns with the narrative of discrediting Ukraine."

      "evidence_quote": "Washington “cannot afford” to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames the US/West's motivation for involvement in the war as securing access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, shifting the cause of the conflict from Russian aggression to Western economic interests."

      "evidence_quote": "While 'promising Ukrainians mountains of gold, Graham in fact considers it as a future American colony,' Dzhabarov said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying the West as deceptive and self-interested, but its specific focus on colonial exploitation and deception is not fully captured by the 'aggressor' subnarratives alone, representing a distinct argument within the broader blame-shifting narrative."

      "evidence_quote": "“They’re sitting on 10 to $12 trillion of critical minerals in Ukraine. They could be the richest country in all of Europe,\" Graham said. \"If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West,”",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly frames Western support for Ukraine as being motivated by access to valuable mineral resources, suggesting the West's primary interest is economic gain rather than Ukraine's sovereignty or welfare."

While \"promising Ukrainians mountains of gold, Graham in fact considers it as a future American colony,\" Dzhabarov said.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by portraying the US as having colonial/imperialist intentions towards Ukraine, which is a distinct theme not covered by the other specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine by reducing the country's sovereignty and the West's involvement to a purely exploitative resource grab. This theme of Ukraine being a resource prize to be fought over, while related to the 'puppet' idea, is a distinct argument that frames the entire conflict and Ukraine's existence in cynical, materialistic terms not fully captured by the other specific subnarratives."

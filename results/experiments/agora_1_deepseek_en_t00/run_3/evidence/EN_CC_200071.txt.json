      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes rising costs of living (housing, fuel, utilities) to green policies, questioning their economic impact and effectiveness, which aligns with the definition of criticizing climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American... who warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The text frames Biden's policies as a 'globalist green agenda' with harmful consequences, challenging the competence and intentions of the administration and its institutions."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment...",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies (wind, solar, biomass), labeling them as inefficient, expensive, and environmentally destructive."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions whether green policies weaken national strength and resilience in the context of geopolitical conflict, framing them as instruments that could compromise geopolitical power."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "\"The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that climate policies are causing unaffordable housing, rent, gasoline, and utility bills, which are negative economic outcomes for average Americans."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "\"These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'\"",
      "reasoning": "This statement argues that the promoted renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are environmentally destructive and incapable of meeting energy needs, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended environmental and practical goals."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames climate policies as undermining national security and military strength, which is a criticism of the policies but does not fit the definitions of the other specific subnarratives (economic impact, ineffectiveness, or profit motive)."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the policies of a specific political figure (President Biden), blaming his 'green policies' for negative economic consequences, which fits the definition of discrediting political figures in the climate change debate."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes... Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the actions of a U.S. government department (Department of Energy) and the broader federal administration for implementing policies (green building codes) that are portrayed as burdensome and financially damaging, which constitutes disapproval of how the national government handles climate change."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the underlying approach and rationale of 'green' energy policy itself, which is a broader criticism of the authorities and institutions promoting it. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities but does not fit neatly into the specific subcategories of criticizing the EU, international entities, national governments, or political figures alone; it targets the foundational logic of the policy agenda."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is unreliable",
      "evidence_quote": "These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly asserts that renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass) are incapable of meeting the energy demands of the nation or world, which aligns with the definition of unreliability for widespread adoption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "Ring added that newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation.",
      "reasoning": "This statement explicitly labels renewable energy sources as 'inefficient and expensive,' directly supporting the subnarrative that they are too costly and inefficient for widespread use."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is dangerous",
      "evidence_quote": "These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance",
      "reasoning": "The claim that renewable energy generation is 'far more destructive to the environment' and requires intensive resource extraction positions it as posing significant risks, aligning with the 'dangerous' subnarrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,' wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "This argument directly supports the parent narrative of controversy about green technologies by blaming them for broad socioeconomic harms (housing and cost of living crises), but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about the energy sources themselves being dangerous, unreliable, costly, or nuclear not being climate-friendly."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Climate-related international relations are abusive/exploitative",
      "evidence_quote": "\"How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"",
      "reasoning": "This quote frames the domestic economic consequences of green policies (unaffordable housing, energy) as a national security weakness, implying that these policies are a form of geopolitical self-sabotage that leaves the country vulnerable to adversaries, which aligns with the idea of international climate relations being exploitative or abusive to national strength."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Edward Ring... warned of the far-reaching consequences of Biden's 'globalist green agenda.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'globalist green agenda' directly frames the policies as instruments of a supranational or international agenda, which supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical instruments. This specific phrasing does not fit neatly into the 'abusive/exploitative' or 'neo-colonialism' subnarratives but clearly advances the core idea that climate policy is a tool for broader geopolitical control or influence."

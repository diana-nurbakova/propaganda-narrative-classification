The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the UK government's competence and consistency on climate policy, highlighting reversals on fracking and the demotion of key climate officials, which challenges the authority's commitment and integrity."

But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This passage criticizes the government's climate policy approach by highlighting inconsistency and demotion of key climate officials, which supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit the specific definitions of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit motive."

The new prime minister restored the moratorium on fracking only weeks after Truss’s government lifted the ban. But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the UK government's inconsistent and seemingly unserious approach to climate policy, highlighting policy reversals and the demotion of key climate officials, which fits the definition of disapproving of how a national government handles climate change."

      "evidence_quote": "The U-turn comes after Sunak came under pressure from climate activists, opposition parties, and some Conservative MPs including his former boss Boris Johnson and the government’s climate czar Alok Sharma, for his planned absence.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames Prime Minister Sunak's decision to attend COP27 as a reluctant reversal forced by criticism, implicitly discrediting his leadership and commitment on climate issues, which aligns with discrediting political figures in the climate debate."

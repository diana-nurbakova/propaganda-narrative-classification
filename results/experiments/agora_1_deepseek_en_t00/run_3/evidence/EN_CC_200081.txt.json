      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the effectiveness and environmental impact of a specific climate policy (wind farm development), framing it as contradictory ('green energy' in scare quotes) and harmful due to tree loss."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity.",
      "reasoning": "This statement lists multiple negative consequences (deforestation, wildlife harm, reliance on problematic mining) associated with wind turbines, expressing clear skepticism and criticism of this green technology."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.",
      "reasoning": "The text links green technology (wind turbines) to dependency on a geopolitical rival ('Communist China'), implying the policy strengthens a foreign power, framing it as a tool of geopolitical influence rather than pure environmentalism."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist-separatist locally-devolved government of the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP)...",
      "reasoning": "The use of politically charged labels ('leftist-separatist') challenges the legitimacy and motives of the governing institution (Scottish government/SNP) implementing the climate policies."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames the wind farm policy as environmentally counterproductive by highlighting the destruction of a large number of trees, which are natural carbon sinks, to build 'green' infrastructure. This suggests the policy fails to achieve its intended environmental goals, as it causes significant ecological harm."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "“I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions 'damage to... business' as a concern raised by rural communities regarding wind farm developments, directly linking the climate policy to negative economic outcomes for local enterprises."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people...",
      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes climate policies (wind farms) by highlighting severe negative social and environmental consequences in the supply chain (human suffering, pollution in China) that are not covered by the other specific subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but introduces a distinct theme of global human cost and dependency on foreign regimes."

      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that the production of wind turbines relies on a process (mining rare earth minerals) that causes severe health and environmental damage, framing renewable energy as dangerous to human health and local ecosystems."

      "evidence_quote": "responding to the letter, Mr Kerr said: “Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,” adding that the government “must be alive” to the “significant costs” of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions the \"significant costs\" associated with wind turbine installation, framing the development as having a high, perhaps hidden, price that the public should be aware of, aligning with the subnarrative that renewable energy is costly."

      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by framing the green energy push as hypocritical or counterproductive (destroying trees for 'green' energy) and uses politically charged language ('leftist', 'supposedly') to criticize the motivation behind the technology. This argument does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of danger, unreliability, cost, or nuclear energy, as it focuses on environmental trade-offs and political ideology."

The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly links Western 'green' wind energy projects to exploitative and harmful mining practices in China, framing the pursuit of renewable energy as a form of externalizing environmental and health costs onto a developing nation, which aligns with the definition of neo-colonialism where developed countries exert control and cause harm to others for their own benefit."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames the Scottish government's green energy policy as hypocritical and destructive, suggesting that the policy is not genuinely environmental but rather a politically motivated instrument ('green madness') that causes significant local environmental damage. This supports the parent narrative that green policies are geopolitical/instrumental, but the specific argument about domestic hypocrisy and destruction does not fit the 'exploitative international relations' or 'neo-colonialism' definitions."

      "reasoning": "This quote, and the article's framing of the government's vow as proceeding 'nevertheless' despite the reported negative consequences, supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities. It criticizes the government's policy commitment and its justification, but this specific argument (persisting with a flawed policy) is not captured by the other, more specific subnarratives."

      "reasoning": "The use of scare quotes around 'green energy' and the context of the article framing the tree felling as 'madness' suggests a dismissal of the climate movement's framing of a 'climate emergency' as exaggerated or alarmist, portraying the 'green' response as counterproductive."

      "reasoning": "This argument criticizes the climate movement's proposed solutions (wind turbines) by highlighting their negative, unintended consequences (environmental damage, reliance on China). It supports the parent narrative of criticizing the movement but does not fit the specific definitions of 'alarmist', 'corrupt', or 'ad hominem attacks'."

      "evidence_quote": "Avdeevka, which was turned into a large stronghold by the Ukrainian military during the war in Donbass.",
      "reasoning": "The phrasing frames Avdiivka's fortification as an action taken 'during the war in Donbass', a term often used in Russian narratives to imply the conflict started before 2022, subtly discrediting Ukraine's defensive posture as part of an earlier aggression."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Russian invasion has strong national support",
      "evidence_quote": "The Russian Defense Ministry said.",
      "reasoning": "The text consistently uses official Russian military sources (e.g., 'the Russian Defense Ministry said') as the primary authority for reporting Russian successes and Ukrainian failures, implicitly presenting the invasion's actions as legitimate and officially supported."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainian forces attempted to reach Russian territory with UAVs. Overnight, two Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the Bryansk region, three more over the Black Sea off the coast of Crimea, the Russian Defense Ministry said.",
      "reasoning": "This frames Russian air defenses as effective and successful in neutralizing Ukrainian threats, which supports the broader narrative of Russian military superiority and operational success, but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives like 'Praise of Russian military might' (which is more about scale and offensive power) or the others listed."

      "evidence_quote": "Meanwhile, the Russian army is developing its offensive in Avdeevka, which was turned into a large stronghold by the Ukrainian military during the war in Donbass.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase frames the conflict in Donbass as an ongoing 'war' initiated before the 2022 invasion, implicitly supporting the Russian narrative that justifies its actions by discrediting Ukraine's pre-2022 military posture as aggressive. It supports the parent narrative but does not fit a more specific subcategory."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "The quote frames climate policy (in this case, guidelines on washing frequency) as an unjust infringement on fundamental personal rights, questioning its motives and impact on daily life."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly challenges the integrity and intentions of the WEF, accusing it of hypocrisy and of targeting ordinary citizens while protecting elite privileges."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Green policies are geopolitical instruments",
      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing 'the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.'",
      "reasoning": "The text connects the WEF's environmental advocacy (the washing guidelines) with its praise for China's policies and its gathering of global elites, suggesting environmental policies are tools for geopolitical alignment and consolidating elite power rather than genuine environmental concern."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The language ('ordered compliant governments', 'move towards a future') portrays the WEF as a shadowy, powerful entity orchestrating a global plan to restrict personal freedoms, fitting the narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote contrasts the proposed policy (restricting laundry) with the massive carbon footprint of the elites promoting it, implying the policy is an ineffective and hypocritical approach to addressing climate change, as it targets minor citizen behaviors while ignoring major polluters."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly argues that climate policies are designed to protect the financial and privileged status of elites ('billionaires and elites') while imposing burdens on ordinary citizens, framing the policies as a tool for maintaining power and profit rather than genuine environmental concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Now, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies by framing them as an extreme, rights-stripping overreach that infringes on personal dignity and fundamental freedoms, a theme not fully captured by the more specific economic or profit-driven subnarratives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) has issued guidelines regarding how often the public should be allowed to wash their clothes... The WEF has already ordered compliant governments to move towards a future in which citizens will be restricted from buying more than a small number of new items of clothing per year.",
      "reasoning": "The text directly criticizes the World Economic Forum (WEF), an international entity, for issuing restrictive guidelines and ordering governments to limit citizens' consumption, framing its actions as an overreach of authority in the context of climate policy."

      "evidence_quote": "In an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes specific political figures and elites ('globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians') for hypocrisy, accusing them of contributing significantly to carbon emissions while advocating for restrictive policies on the public."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions/authorities by accusing the WEF of protecting elite privileges while targeting citizens' rights, but it does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives of criticizing the EU, national governments, or international entities in the defined sense. It is a broader criticism of the institution's motives and elitism."

      "evidence_quote": "During the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing “the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.”",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by implying that green policies and forums like the WEF are instruments for geopolitical alignment and influence, specifically praising China's model, which is a distinct argument not covered by the more specific subnarratives of abuse or neo-colonialism."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes the climate policy of restricting laundry to a secretive, powerful group (the WEF and its associated elites), framing it as a deliberate act by the elite to preserve their own privileges while taking rights from ordinary citizens."

      "reasoning": "This statement frames the climate change agenda (promoted by Klaus Schwab and the WEF) as having the ulterior motive of stripping away fundamental personal rights and freedoms, rather than being a genuine environmental effort."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative of hidden plots by powerful groups by highlighting their hypocrisy and secretive, self-serving behavior, but it does not fit neatly into the 'Blaming global elites' or 'Climate agenda has hidden motives' definitions as it focuses on elite hypocrisy rather than directly blaming them for the agenda or stating its hidden purpose."

      "reasoning": "The quote positively highlights Russia's economic resilience and stability in the face of international sanctions, framing its export performance as a key factor in ensuring the country's economic performance. This is an expression of positive evaluation of Russia's actions and economic strength."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes Western countries, suggesting their efforts to pressure Russia (through sanctions) have been ineffective and miscalculated. It undermines the competence and strategy of Western foreign policy."

      "reasoning": "This statement highlights a consequence of Western sanctions—the consolidation of Russia's energy partnership with China.

      "reasoning": "This quote praises Russia's resilience and economic performance in the face of Western sanctions, supporting the parent narrative of praising Russia. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about military might, Putin, peace/prosperity, or national/international support for the invasion, as it focuses on economic resilience and the failure of Western pressure."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly claims that Western countries overestimated their ability to exert effective pressure on Russia, portraying the West's actions as ineffectual and its power as diminished, which aligns with the definition of presenting the West as non-potent."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement, in the context of Western sanctions, supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by implying that Western actions (sanctions) have backfired, strengthening Russia's partnership with China instead of isolating it. This argument discredits the West's strategic approach but does not fit neatly into the other, more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "evidence_quote": "Segundo ele, os países ocidentais sobrestimaram a eficácia da pressão que conseguiriam fazer sobre a Rússia.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western pressure (sanctions) has been less effective than anticipated, implying the sanctions have failed and thus backfired by not achieving their intended goal of crippling Russia."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "O cenário consolidou a China como a principal compradora do petróleo russo no mercado internacional.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by showing a negative consequence for the West: Western sanctions have pushed Russia into a stronger economic partnership with China, thereby reducing Western influence and creating a rival economic bloc, which is a strategic loss for the West not covered by the other specific subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "So now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism... The climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the motives and integrity of the climate movement, framing it as a disguise for radical leftist ideology rather than a genuine environmental concern."

      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a 'scam' which facilitates 'greenwashing, lying and cheating'.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes the integrity and intentions of the COP institution, suggesting it is deceptive and ineffective, which aligns with the definition of challenging institutions and authorities."

      "reasoning": "This quote implies a hidden agenda by powerful groups (e.g., far-left environmentalists) to overthrow Western systems, fitting the narrative of secret schemes by powerful groups."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Thunberg made the extremist comments during an appearance on Sunday night at London’s Royal Festival Hall to promote her new ‘Climate Book’. Previously, she’d sold herself as a five-foot human alarm bell, a climate Cassandra.",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly describes Greta Thunberg's rhetoric as 'extremist' and compares her to a 'climate Cassandra,' implying that she exaggerates the severity of climate change for dramatic effect, which aligns with the definition of the subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt",
      "evidence_quote": "COP itself is little more than a 'scam' which facilitates 'greenwashing, lying and cheating'. Only overthrow of 'the whole capitalist system' will suffice.",
      "reasoning": "The text alleges that the climate movement (via COP) is engaged in 'greenwashing, lying and cheating,' suggesting ulterior motives and unethical practices, which fits the definition of the subnarrative."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Nicholas Harris from UnHerd was there to watch Thunberg outline her demented manifesto. [...] her message was more radical and more militant than it has been in the past.",
      "reasoning": "The text attacks Greta Thunberg's reputation by calling her manifesto 'demented' and labeling her message as 'radical and militant,' which constitutes a direct ad hominem attack on a key activist."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "As we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format. [...] So there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.",
      "reasoning": "The text argues that the climate movement's true goal is to dismantle Western capitalism and replace it with a far-left ideology, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions. This is distinct evidence that warrants inclusion under 'Other.'"

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Blaming global elites",
      "evidence_quote": "We can’t trust the elites produced by this system to confront its flaws – that’s why she, much like Rishi Sunak, won’t be bothering with the COP meeting this year. COP itself is little more than a 'scam' which facilitates 'greenwashing, lying and cheating'.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly attributes the climate agenda to deceptive actions by 'elites' and portrays COP as a manipulative scheme, aligning with the subnarrative of blaming global elites for hidden control over climate discourse."

Basden asserted that whatever climate problems exist can’t be fixed and that the movement should instead be focused on tearing down the entire system of western capitalism.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly supports the subnarrative by asserting that climate movements are a pretext for dismantling capitalism, implying a hidden agenda beyond environmentalism."

      "reasoning": "While this quote reinforces the parent narrative of hidden plots, it extends beyond the provided subnarratives by framing the climate agenda as a tool for systemic overthrow (identity politics/totalitarianism), which is not explicitly covered by the other subnarratives."

He claimed that 'European civilisation' is to blame for spreading 'cruelty' and 'violence' throughout the globe for the last 600 years... 'The delusions of hetero-sexism/heteronormativity propagate the idea that heterosexuality is 'normal' and that other expressions of sexuality are deviant.'",
      "reasoning": "These quotes criticize climate policies and movements by framing them as part of a broader ideological agenda unrelated to environmentalism, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. The focus on systemic overthrow and identity politics as the true goals of climate activism extends beyond the specific subnarratives provided."

It is included as evidence of a broader controversy about green technologies."

So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the war in Ukraine away from Russia (the invader) and toward China, implying that China is responsible for enabling the conflict rather than acknowledging Russia's role as the aggressor."

      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes Western diplomatic and informational efforts, portraying them as ineffective and disconnected from global opinion, which aligns with the definition of discrediting the West and its diplomacy."

      "evidence_quote": "All this lunacy was on full display in Washington last week, at the Nato’s celebration of death and destruction with its 75th anniversary summit. A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism... That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one.",
      "reasoning": "This quote evokes fear by suggesting that NATO's actions are leading to a third world war, amplifying anxiety about escalating global conflict, which fits the definition of amplifying war-related fears."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for the war away from Russia (the invader) and onto the West and China, portraying the West as the primary aggressor by framing their military support for Ukraine as escalatory and misplaced. It also dismisses Western narratives about China's role, reinforcing the idea that the West is responsible for prolonging and expanding the conflict."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by blaming the West (particularly the U.S. and NATO) for expanding the war beyond Ukraine and framing it as a global conflict instigated by Western actions. While it aligns with the broader theme of shifting blame, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or China, hence the use of 'Other'."

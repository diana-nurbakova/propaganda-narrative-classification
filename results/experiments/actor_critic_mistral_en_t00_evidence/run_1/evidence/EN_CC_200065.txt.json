      "evidence_quote": "Climate alarmists are lamenting July’s warm weather, asserting earth saw its hottest day on record this week and likely 'the hottest day in thousands of years.'",
      "reasoning": "The term 'climate alarmists' is used pejoratively to challenge the motives and integrity of those advocating for climate action, implying they are exaggerating or sensationalizing the issue. This directly aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",
      "evidence_quote": "These are astonishing contentions considering that temperature data collection only began in the 19th century.",
      "reasoning": "The text raises doubts about the scientific methods and data used to assert historical temperature records, specifically questioning the reliability of proxy records like tree rings and ice cores. This aligns with the narrative of questioning the measurements and science."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Questioning the measurements and science",

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly challenges the validity and comparability of proxy data used in climate science, reinforcing doubts about the scientific consensus and methods. This is a clear example of questioning the measurements and science."

      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This dismissive remark minimizes the significance of climate change findings by suggesting they are exaggerated or fabricated for dramatic effect, which aligns with the narrative of downplaying climate change."

Not content with these extravagant claims, the article goes on to assert that 2024 is 'the planet’s hottest year yet since at least the pre-industrial era, and likely for at least 100,000 years before that' (emphasis added).",
      "reasoning": "The text explicitly labels climate advocates as 'alarmists' and highlights their claims as 'extravagant,' suggesting exaggeration of climate change severity for dramatic effect. This directly aligns with the definition of the subnarrative 'Climate movement is alarmist.'"

      "evidence_quote": "But who wants to let science get in the way of a good story?",
      "reasoning": "This phrase undermines the credibility of the climate movement by implying that its claims are driven by narrative rather than scientific rigor. While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks,' thus qualifying for 'Other.'"

      "reasoning": "The text implies that claims of record-breaking temperatures over long historical periods (e.g., 100,000 years) are unsupported by direct data, as reliable temperature records only exist from the 19th century onward. This undermines assertions of long-term temperature increases."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting the limitations of historical temperature data but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives. It emphasizes the lack of long-term direct measurements, which indirectly questions the validity of claims about temperatures over millennia."

Moreover, because proxy records from things like tree rings, pollen counts, and ice cores differ fundamentally from direct measurements, 'scientists typically do not include them on the same charts as the instrumental record,' NASA revealed.",
      "reasoning": "The quote directly questions the reliability of methodologies and metrics used to estimate historical temperatures, particularly proxy records like tree rings and ice cores, by highlighting their fundamental differences from direct measurements and the lack of sufficient data before 1880."

      "reasoning": "The phrase 'Climate alarmists' and the framing of the claims as extravagant or sensational support the parent narrative but do not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions. This suggests a broader attempt to undermine the credibility of climate science claims without directly addressing methodologies or data."

      "reasoning": "The text emphasizes the limitations of historical temperature data to cast doubt on the significance of current temperature increases, implying they may not be as impactful or unprecedented as claimed."

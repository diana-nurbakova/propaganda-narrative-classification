      "evidence_quote": "Russia-linked accounts are disseminating divisive content aimed at U.S. audiences, including criticizing American support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, researchers at the tech giant said in a report.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that Russia is shifting blame for the conflict by criticizing U.S. support for Ukraine, rather than acknowledging Russia's role as the invader. This aligns with the narrative of attributing responsibility to others."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "That content is then covered by a network of websites that include DC Weekly, Miami Chronical and The Intel Drop. 'Ultimately, after the narrative has circulated online for a series of days or weeks, U.S. audiences repeat and repost this disinformation, likely unaware of its original source,' Microsoft said.",
      "reasoning": "The quote undermines confidence in media sources by highlighting how disinformation is spread through seemingly legitimate websites and reposted by unsuspecting audiences, fostering distrust in the reliability of information."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia-linked accounts are disseminating divisive content aimed at U.S. audiences, including criticizing American support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, researchers at the tech giant said in a report.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes U.S. foreign policy (support for Ukraine) and implies hypocrisy or ineffectiveness in Western diplomatic efforts, which aligns with the narrative of discrediting the West."

      "evidence_quote": "Russia-linked accounts are disseminating divisive content aimed at U.S. audiences, including criticizing American support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, researchers at the tech giant said in a report.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shows Russia-linked accounts framing the U.S. (part of the Western block) as responsible for escalating the conflict by supporting Ukraine, thereby shifting blame away from Russia as the invader and portraying the West as the aggressor."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "It also dismissed U.S. allegations that it orchestrated campaigns to sway the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by deflecting responsibility for malicious activities (e.g., election interference) away from Russia and implying that the U.S. is falsely accusing Russia to cover its own actions or intentions. While it does not fit the specific subnarratives directly, it reinforces the broader theme of blaming others."

      "evidence_quote": "That content is then covered by a network of websites that include DC Weekly, Miami Chronical and The Intel Drop. 'Ultimately, after the narrative has circulated online for a series of days or weeks, U.S. audiences repeat and repost this disinformation, likely unaware of its original source,' Microsoft said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly describes a process where Russian-affiliated sources create content that is then amplified by Western-sounding media outlets (e.g., DC Weekly, Miami Chronical), implying these outlets are unwitting or complicit tools for spreading disinformation. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda, as it suggests these outlets are being manipulated to disseminate false narratives."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Messaging regarding Ukraine - via traditional media and social media - picked up steam over the last two months with a mix of covert and overt campaigns from at least 70 Russia-affiliated activity sets we track... The most prolific of such Russian campaigns is linked to Russia's Presidential Administration.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by implying that traditional media (a broad category that includes Western media) is being used as a vehicle for Russian disinformation campaigns. While it does not fit the specific subnarrative of 'Western media is an instrument of propaganda' neatly, it still contributes to the broader theme of distrust toward media by suggesting that media channels are being exploited for manipulative purposes."

      "evidence_quote": "It also dismissed U.S. allegations that it orchestrated campaigns to sway the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the West (specifically the U.S.) is making disproportionate or unfounded claims about Russian interference, implying an overreaction to Russia’s actions."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia-linked accounts are disseminating divisive content aimed at U.S. audiences, including criticizing American support of Ukraine in its war with Russia, researchers at the tech giant said in a report.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that the U.S. is supporting Ukraine not out of genuine concern for Ukraine’s fate but as part of a broader strategy to serve its own interests, aligning with the subnarrative definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Rarely have nation-states' employments of generative AI-enabled content achieved much reach across social media, and in only a few cases have we seen any genuine audience deception from such content. The simplest manipulations, not the most complex employment of AI, will likely be the pieces of content that have the most impact.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Western concerns about Russian disinformation by downplaying the effectiveness of Russian tactics, which supports the parent narrative of discrediting the West but does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided."

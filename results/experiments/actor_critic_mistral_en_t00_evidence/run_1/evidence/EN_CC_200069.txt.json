    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the implementation of street zoning barriers, which are likely part of climate or traffic reduction policies, by framing them as an unjust imposition and celebrating their destruction. This directly questions the effectiveness and acceptability of such climate-related measures."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' implies a belief that climate policies are a deceitful scheme orchestrated by institutions and authorities, challenging their integrity and intentions. The text also frames resistance against these policies as a justified and heroic act, further undermining trust in authorities."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "It’s very inspiring to see the people of the UK take matters into their own hands. This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The text portrays the climate movement and its policies as a 'con' and encourages resistance against it, directly challenging the motives and impact of the climate movement. The framing of resistance as 'inspiring' further criticizes the movement's legitimacy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups",
      "evidence_quote": "The Climate Con",
      "reasoning": "The repeated use of the term 'The Climate Con' suggests a belief in a hidden agenda or deceitful plot by powerful groups (e.g., governments, institutions) to manipulate the public under the guise of climate action. This aligns with the narrative of secret schemes by powerful entities."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.",
      "reasoning": "The destruction of street zoning barriers implies that residents view these climate-related measures as ineffective or counterproductive, suggesting the policies fail to achieve their intended goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' frames climate policies as deceptive or fraudulent, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the predefined subnarratives. This phrase reinforces the idea that climate policies are not genuine but rather a manipulative scheme."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers... Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The text criticizes the UK government's climate policies by framing them as 'climate change madness' and portraying resistance against government-imposed street zoning barriers as justified. This directly disapproves of how the national government is handling climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "Piers Corbyn and friends are taking to the streets on Friday the 13th of January.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of Piers Corbyn, a political figure associated with opposition to climate policies, implies discrediting of political organizations and figures involved in the climate change debate, aligning with the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'The Climate Con' broadly criticizes institutions and authorities involved in climate policy but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided. It supports the parent narrative by framing climate action as deceptive or manipulative, warranting inclusion under 'Other'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'climate change madness' suggests that the climate movement is exaggerating the severity of climate change, framing it as irrational or overly dramatic, which aligns with the definition of the subnarrative 'Climate movement is alarmist'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con.",
      "reasoning": "The term 'The Climate Con' implies that the climate movement is deceptive or fraudulent, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the other specific subnarratives. This constitutes a remainder that requires the 'Other' subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives",
      "evidence_quote": "THE GREAT CLIMATE CON",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'THE GREAT CLIMATE CON' explicitly frames the climate change agenda as a deceptive scheme, implying that the push for climate action is driven by hidden, ulterior motives rather than genuine environmental concerns. This aligns with the subnarrative definition of claiming the climate agenda has hidden motives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "resistance to The Climate Con",
      "reasoning": "The repeated use of the term 'The Climate Con' throughout the text reinforces the idea of a hidden plot by powerful groups, but it does so in a broader, less specific way than the other subnarratives. This phrase supports the parent narrative by framing climate policies as part of a manipulative scheme without explicitly attributing it to global elites or detailing specific hidden motives beyond deception itself."

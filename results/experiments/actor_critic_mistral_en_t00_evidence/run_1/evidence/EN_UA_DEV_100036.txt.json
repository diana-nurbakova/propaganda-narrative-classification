      "evidence_quote": "As Ukraine endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion, the impact extends far beyond the physical destruction of its cities and the displacement of its people.",
      "reasoning": "While the text explicitly mentions 'Russia's full-scale invasion,' the focus is primarily on the consequences for Ukraine rather than assigning direct blame to Russia for initiating the war. However, this narrative is not strongly present, as the text does not shift blame to other entities. The closest potential for this narrative would be if the text implied Ukraine or the West provoked the conflict, which it does not."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "This crisis in healthcare is set against a backdrop of long-standing distrust in mental health services in Ukraine, a legacy of the Soviet era when the psychiatric system was used to oppress dissidents and enemies of the state. A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights systemic issues within Ukraine's mental health services, portraying them as historically flawed and distrusted by the population. While this is framed as a challenge rather than an attack, it still undermines the effectiveness and legitimacy of Ukraine's healthcare infrastructure."

      "evidence_quote": "The full-scale invasion has magnified Ukraine's pre-existing challenges and introduced larger societal issues. The collective impact of population displacement, healthcare infrastructure destruction, and economic hardships contributes significantly to the deteriorating mental health of the society. Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",
      "reasoning": "The text evokes fear and anxiety by emphasizing the profound and ongoing psychological trauma, economic hardships, and uncertainty about the future caused by the war. It highlights the lack of an end in sight, which amplifies the sense of dread and instability."

      "evidence_quote": "As Ukraine endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion, the impact extends far beyond the physical destruction of its cities and the displacement of its people.",
      "reasoning": "While the text explicitly mentions 'Russia's full-scale invasion,' the broader framing of the article focuses on the consequences of the war (e.g., mental health crisis, economic hardship, displacement) without directly attributing blame to Russia for starting the war. This could implicitly support a narrative that shifts focus away from Russia's aggression by emphasizing the suffering of Ukrainians as a result of external forces (e.g., the war itself, rather than the invader). However, this is a weak fit for the subnarrative. A stronger case is absent, so this may not fully align. Re-evaluating, the text does not explicitly blame the West or Ukraine, but the parent narrative is present in the framing of consequences rather than responsibility."

      "evidence_quote": "The ongoing war in Ukraine has also significantly impacted the nation's healthcare infrastructure... In 2022, there were 707 documented attacks on Ukrainian health care facilities, resulting in significant destruction of or damage to 218 hospitals and clinics...",
      "reasoning": "The text supports the parent narrative by focusing on the consequences of the war (e.g., attacks on healthcare, mental health crisis) without explicitly reiterating Russia's role as the aggressor. While Russia is mentioned as the invader, the emphasis on the war's impact rather than the invader's responsibility aligns with the parent narrative of deflecting blame. This does not fit the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West but still supports the broader theme of shifting focus away from the invader."

      "evidence_quote": "The full-scale invasion has magnified Ukraine's pre-existing challenges and introduced larger societal issues. The collective impact of population displacement, healthcare infrastructure destruction, and economic hardships contributes significantly to the deteriorating mental health of the society. Ukrainians' reluctance to plan for the future reflects the deep psychological impact of the war, which there is no end in sight for now.",

The challenges within Ukraine extend beyond physical dangers. Financial hardships are widespread, with 78% reporting reduced incomes and a third losing jobs due to the war. Consumer prices surged by 20% in 2022, and government aid doesn’t help much.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the Ukrainian government's policies and effectiveness, particularly in addressing the financial hardships of internally displaced persons. It portrays the government as inadequate and ineffective, which aligns with the subnarrative's definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The impact of the war extends beyond physical damage, as it profoundly traumatizes Ukrainian society and threatens to affect future generations. The destruction of infrastructure and economic downturn complicates access to quality mental health services, a critical issue as the country grapples with the widespread societal trauma caused by the war. A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments. This perception presents a significant challenge in encouraging people to seek necessary mental health treatment.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by highlighting systemic failures and societal trauma in Ukraine, it does not neatly fit into any of the specific subnarratives provided. It underscores long-standing issues in mental health infrastructure and societal distrust, which contribute to discrediting Ukraine but are not explicitly covered by the predefined subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "As Ukraine endures the ravages of Russia's full-scale invasion, the impact extends far beyond the physical destruction of its cities and the displacement of its people.",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'Russia's full-scale invasion' is presented as a given, but the broader context of the article focuses on the consequences of the war without explicitly justifying Russia's actions. However, the absence of any mention of Russia's aggression as a deliberate act (e.g., framing it as a response to perceived threats) subtly aligns with the subnarrative that Russia's actions are defensive rather than offensive. The framing implies the war is an unavoidable reality rather than a choice, which indirectly supports the self-defense justification."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Russia is the Victim: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The mental toll of Russia's invasion on Ukrainians is profound... Russia’s war against Ukraine has led to significant territorial occupation, destruction of homes, and one of the largest migration crises this century.",
      "reasoning": "While the text describes the consequences of the war on Ukraine, it consistently attributes the war to 'Russia' or 'Russia’s invasion' without acknowledging any broader geopolitical context or Western involvement that might be used to frame Russia as a victim of external pressures. However, the passive framing of Russia as the sole aggressor without counter-narratives (e.g., NATO expansion, Western support for Ukraine) subtly reinforces the parent narrative by omitting any potential justification for Russia's actions. This omission leaves room for the interpretation that Russia is being unfairly vilified, which aligns with the parent narrative but does not fit the specific subnarratives provided."

      "evidence_quote": "Nonetheless, Ukrainian resilience knows no limits, and the people will endure whatever it takes for the cause of victory, as the sacrifices being made are endless for its people.",
      "reasoning": "While the text primarily focuses on the mental health crisis in Ukraine due to Russia's invasion, this closing statement subtly shifts to praising the endurance and resilience of Ukrainians in the face of Russian aggression. This indirectly supports the parent narrative by implying that Russia's actions, though destructive, are ultimately futile against Ukrainian determination, which could be interpreted as a form of indirect praise for Russia's perceived strength or inevitability of its actions."

      "evidence_quote": "Those registered as internally displaced people (IDPs) can receive a monthly allowance of UAH 2,000 ($52.77) per adult and UAH 3,000 ($79.15) per child from the program that was created by the government.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights the inadequacy of financial support for internally displaced Ukrainians, implying that Western aid or broader international support is insufficient or self-serving, as the amounts are minimal and do not address the scale of the crisis. This aligns with the subnarrative that the West prioritizes its own interests over Ukraine's well-being."

      "evidence_quote": "The mental toll of Russia's invasion on Ukrainians is profound. In June 2022, Health Minister Viktor Liashko predicted that around 15 million Ukrainians would need psychological support, with up to 4 million requiring medical treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) also found that 1 in 5 Ukrainians couldn’t get the medication they needed; cost, availability, and long queues at local pharmacies are the top three reasons.",
      "reasoning": "The text emphasizes the severe mental health crisis and lack of access to medical care in Ukraine, indirectly suggesting that Western reactions (e.g., sanctions, military aid) have not alleviated the suffering. This could be interpreted as implying that the West's focus on punitive measures against Russia is disproportionate or ineffective, aligning with the subnarrative that the West is overreacting."

      "evidence_quote": "The challenges within Ukraine extend beyond physical dangers. Financial hardships are widespread, with 78% reporting reduced incomes and a third losing jobs due to the war. Consumer prices surged by 20% in 2022, and missile strikes on energy infrastructure have disrupted daily life and work.",
      "reasoning": "This quote underscores the economic and infrastructural devastation in Ukraine, which could be framed as a failure of Western support or diplomacy to mitigate the war's consequences. While it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, it supports the parent narrative by implying that the West has not effectively addressed Ukraine's broader crisis."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: The conflict will increase the Ukrainian refugee flows to Europe",
      "evidence_quote": "Those who fled to western Ukraine speak to the extremely high rent prices due to high demand, and government aid doesn’t help much. [...] The separation and the fear of return, especially to areas constantly under missile strikes, adds a significant mental burden to Ukrainians. [...] Over time, these families often adapt to life in their new countries, with children assimilating and over time, they no longer identify Ukraine as their home anymore.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the challenges faced by Ukrainian refugees, including financial hardships and the difficulty of returning to Ukraine due to ongoing conflict. It also emphasizes the long-term integration of Ukrainian families into foreign countries, which implies a potential increase in refugee flows to Europe and their prolonged stay, aligning with the subnarrative of catastrophizing refugee outflows due to the conflict."

[...] The destruction of infrastructure and economic downturn complicates access to quality mental health services, a critical issue as the country grapples with the widespread societal trauma caused by the war. [...] The collective impact of population displacement, healthcare infrastructure destruction, and economic hardships contributes significantly to the deteriorating mental health of the society.",
      "reasoning": "While the text primarily focuses on the internal consequences of the war for Ukraine, it also implicitly suggests broader destabilizing effects that could indirectly impact the West. The emphasis on societal trauma, economic hardship, and infrastructure collapse paints a picture of a prolonged crisis that may strain Western support systems, humanitarian aid, and geopolitical stability. This does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but still supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West."

A 2021 study revealed that 75% of Ukrainian adults perceived psychiatric hospitals as prison-like rather than therapeutic environments.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not directly target media institutions, it reinforces a broader narrative of systemic distrust within Ukrainian institutions, including healthcare, which aligns with the parent narrative of fostering distrust. This quote supports the idea that Ukrainians have deep-seated skepticism toward state-affiliated systems, which can indirectly contribute to distrust in other institutions like media, even if not explicitly stated."

      "reasoning": "The text amplifies fears about the prolonged and escalating nature of the war, its societal impacts, and the uncertainty of its resolution. While this supports the parent narrative of amplifying war-related fears, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other'."

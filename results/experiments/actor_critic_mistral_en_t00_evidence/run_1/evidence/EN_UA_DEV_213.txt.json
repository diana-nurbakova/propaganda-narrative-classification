      "evidence_quote": "The above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: 'Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter...'",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights perceived hypocrisy in Western diplomatic rhetoric, accusing the West of violating international law while criticizing Russia, thus discrediting Western diplomacy."

      "evidence_quote": "As in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s 'aluminum tubes' and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as 'evidence' satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia... All of this amounts to nothing.",

It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.'",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit the specific subnarratives of 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors,' it still supports the parent narrative by dismissing NATO's role in the crisis and shifting blame entirely onto Putin, thus justifying the inclusion of 'Other'."

In the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.",
      "reasoning": "This argument suggests that the West and Ukraine are fabricating pretexts for aggression, which does not neatly fit the predefined subnarratives but still supports the parent narrative by deflecting blame from Russia."

The claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.",
      "reasoning": "This quote discredits the potential for diplomatic efforts by suggesting that the West is not genuinely interested in negotiations and is instead using the pretext of a closing window for diplomacy to justify war, aligning with the subnarrative that diplomacy is ineffective or insincere."

      "evidence_quote": "Even if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have 'nothing to do with expansion by NATO,' which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance?",

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the competence and actions of German authorities and institutions in handling the coal mine expansion and the protests, implying they are acting in a way that is shameful or inappropriate."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "She and other activists say expanding the coal mine would contribute to the climate crisis and be counterproductive to Germany’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "reasoning": "This statement questions the effectiveness and motives behind Germany's climate policies, particularly the approval of coal expansion projects despite commitments to reduce emissions, aligning with the definition of criticizing climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Interactions between the activists and police have grown violent at times, resulting in the hospitalizations of at least nine demonstrators.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not directly criticize the climate movement, it implicitly challenges the impact and methods of the activists by highlighting the negative consequences (violence and hospitalizations) of their protests, which could be interpreted as a critique of the movement's approach."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the German government's actions and decisions, specifically in the context of climate policy and the handling of the coal mine expansion, aligning with the definition of disapproval of national governments' handling of climate change."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "the Garzweiler coal mine, owned by European energy giant RWE, can expand.",
      "reasoning": "While not explicitly naming political figures, the criticism of RWE—a major energy corporation with close ties to political decision-making—implies disapproval of the political and economic structures enabling the coal expansion, fitting the subnarrative of discrediting political organizations and figures in the climate debate."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Police told the BBC they arrested Thunberg and others after they “rushed towards the ledge” of the mine. All will be released without charges after their identities are checked, police said.",
      "reasoning": "This portion of the text criticizes the actions of law enforcement (an authority institution) in handling the protest, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives. It highlights distrust in the police's role in the climate debate context."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "She and other activists say expanding the coal mine would contribute to the climate crisis and be counterproductive to Germany’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly states that the coal mine expansion is counterproductive to Germany's climate commitments, implying that the country's climate policies are ineffective in achieving their environmental goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "The country has pledged to phase out coal power generation by 2030, but it also recently approved coal expansion projects, saying they’re necessary to maintain the country’s energy security as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to disrupt oil and gas supplies.",
      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that Germany's climate policies (phasing out coal) are being compromised for economic and energy security reasons, implying that strict climate policies could negatively impact the economy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists",
      "evidence_quote": "Video captured at the protest showed three officers carrying a seemingly unbothered Thunberg, 20, away from the demonstration...",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'seemingly unbothered' subtly undermines Thunberg's commitment and sincerity, implying she is not genuinely concerned about the protest or its cause. This constitutes an ad hominem attack by questioning her character and dedication."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "“Germany is really embarrassing itself right now,” Thunberg told reporters on Friday.",
      "reasoning": "This quote is used to frame Thunberg's statement as an overreach or an unjustified criticism of Germany's policies, which supports the parent narrative by implying the climate movement is unreasonable or overly critical without acknowledging the broader context of the protest or Germany's coal expansion plans."

      "evidence_quote": "Biden’s green policies are making housing no longer affordable for the average American",
      "reasoning": "The statement directly criticizes the economic impact of climate policies, specifically targeting their role in increasing housing costs, which aligns with the definition of questioning the effectiveness and economic consequences of climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly blames green policies for rising costs of essentials, reinforcing the narrative of criticizing the economic impact of climate policies."

      "evidence_quote": "Biden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that 'lower greenhouse gas emissions' and fight the so-called 'climate crisis.'",
      "reasoning": "The phrase 'so-called climate crisis' and the framing of the program as an imposition challenge the integrity and intentions of the Biden administration and its institutions regarding climate change."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "newer energy sources will come from more inefficient and expensive wind, solar and biomass energy generation. These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance 'and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses skepticism and criticism of renewable energy technologies, highlighting perceived inefficiencies and environmental harms, which fits the definition of controversy about green technologies."

This additional spending for owners of houses and residential buildings comes at a period in the United States when families are already struggling to afford a home.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes climate policies by highlighting the financial burden of compliance with new building codes on homeowners, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It emphasizes the unaffordability of housing as a consequence of policy implementation."

Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes... could make energy costs even more expensive as cheap natural gas disappears.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing climate policies, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It focuses on the coercive nature of policy implementation and the potential for increased costs due to regulatory burdens, which is distinct from the other subnarratives."

'The consequences of 'green' policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,' wrote Ring.",
      "reasoning": "The text discredits political figures (Biden) and organizations (the Biden administration) by associating them with a 'globalist green agenda' and portraying their policies as economically damaging. This aligns with the definition of criticizing political organizations and figures in the context of climate change debate."

It supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the existing subnarrative definitions, warranting the inclusion of 'Other'."

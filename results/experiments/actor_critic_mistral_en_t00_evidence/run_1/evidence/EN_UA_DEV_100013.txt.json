      "reasoning": "The quote directly attacks the legitimacy and moral character of a high-ranking Ukrainian official, Zaluzhny, by accusing him of having 'blood on his hands' and associating him with criminality. This aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine by undermining its representatives and actions."

With Labour preparing to implement a major escalation of the war following a scheduled NATO conference on July 9-12...",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes Western political leadership (UK's Labour Party) and NATO's diplomatic efforts, framing them as aggressive and undemocratic. This aligns with the narrative of discrediting the West and its diplomatic actions."

      "evidence_quote": "the intention was to deliver a letter demanding the release of our comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk to the ambassador. The SBU secret service are attempting to frame Bogdan, a Trotskyist opponent of NATO’s proxy war, the Zelensky regime and of Russia’s invasion, as a supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that NATO and the Zelensky regime are primarily responsible for the conflict, framing it as a 'proxy war' and shifting blame away from Russia's invasion. This aligns with the narrative of blaming others for the war."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implies that the portrayal of Russia's actions as an 'imperial-style land grab' is a narrative pushed by Ukraine and the West, shifting blame away from Russia's invasion by framing it as a defensive or reactive stance."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict.",

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "a major new package of aid for Kyiv has been held up in the U.S. Congress.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes Western diplomatic efforts by highlighting delays in aid to Ukraine, implying inefficiency or failure in Western support."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes",
      "evidence_quote": "Will it be Kyiv? Yes, it probably should be Kyiv. If not now, then after some time, maybe in some other phase of the development of this conflict.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly predicts future military actions and outcomes, fitting the definition of speculating about war outcomes."
    },

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The West has committed about 250 billion euros ($271 billion) worth of aid to Ukraine in an attempt to defeat Russian forces.",

      "reasoning": "The quote portrays Russia as being unfairly accused of aggressive intentions, which aligns with the narrative of Russia being victimized by Western and Ukrainian narratives."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for the conflict by implying that the West and Ukraine are falsely portraying Russia's actions as aggressive, while also suggesting that Western warnings about Russia's intentions are unfounded or manipulative. This aligns with the subnarrative of portraying the West as the true aggressors or instigators of the conflict."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev said Russia also wanted to take the Black Sea port of Odesa, which it calls Odessa. 'Odessa, come home. We have been waiting for Odessa in the Russian Federation because of the history of this city, what kind of people live there, what language they speak. It is our Russian, Russian city,' Medvedev said.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by justifying Russia's territorial ambitions in Ukraine as a natural or historical reclamation, rather than an act of aggression. While it does not fit the specific subnarratives of blaming Ukraine or the West directly, it reinforces the broader theme of deflecting responsibility for the war by framing Russia's actions as legitimate."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might",
      "evidence_quote": "Russian troops will go much further into Ukraine, taking the southern city of Odesa and might even one day push on to the capital Kyiv... After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization... Russia is now seeking to recapture the initiative across the 1,000 km (600-mile) front line, where its troops are dug in behind deep mine fields patrolled by drones and guarded by heavy artillery.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights Russia's military capabilities, territorial advances, and strategic positioning, portraying its forces as resilient, well-equipped, and dominant on the battlefield. This aligns with the subnarrative of praising Russian military might."

      "reasoning": "The quote attributes military success and strategic foresight to Putin, presenting him as an effective leader who is guiding Russia to victory. This supports the subnarrative of praising Vladimir Putin."

      "reasoning": "Medvedev's statement frames the invasion as a reclaiming of historically and culturally Russian territory, implying broad national support for the military campaign. This aligns with the subnarrative of emphasizing strong national backing for the invasion."

      "evidence_quote": "Medvedev's comments appeared to reflect increasing confidence in Moscow about the course of the conflict... Russia says the territory its forces control is part of Russia and that it will never be given up.",
      "reasoning": "These statements support the parent narrative by portraying Russia as resolute and confident in its objectives, but they do not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. They emphasize Russia's determination and perceived legitimacy in its actions, warranting inclusion under 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "The West has committed about 250 billion euros ($271 billion) worth of aid to Ukraine in an attempt to defeat Russian forces",
      "reasoning": "The phrasing 'in an attempt to defeat Russian forces' subtly frames Western aid as a strategic move to counter Russia rather than a genuine concern for Ukraine's sovereignty or well-being, aligning with the subnarrative that the West is self-interested."

      "evidence_quote": "Putin's suggestion of a ceasefire in Ukraine to freeze the war was rejected by the United States after contacts between intermediaries",

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying the West's warnings as exaggerated or unfounded (since Putin denies them), which discredits Western diplomatic and strategic narratives but does not fit neatly into the provided subnarratives."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly states Ukraine's intention to reclaim all occupied territories, implying a speculative outcome where Russia loses control of these areas. It directly aligns with the subnarrative definition of predicting Russia's loss of occupied territories."

      "evidence_quote": "After the failure of Ukraine to pierce Russian front lines last year, Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilization and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sacked his top general.",
      "reasoning": "This statement speculates on the war's trajectory by highlighting Ukraine's struggles (e.g., failed counteroffensive, leadership changes) and Russia's strategic advantage, supporting the parent narrative of war outcome speculation. However, it does not fit the specific subnarratives of either army collapsing or losing territories, hence classified as 'Other'."

      "evidence_quote": "The West has committed about 250 billion euros ($271 billion) worth of aid to Ukraine in an attempt to defeat Russian forces.",
      "reasoning": "The text implies that Western financial and military aid to Ukraine is a futile effort, suggesting that such support will not achieve its goals and may ultimately harm Western interests, aligning with the subnarrative that Western sanctions or interventions will backfire."

      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine and the West cast the war as an imperial-style land grab by Putin, and have warned that if Ukraine loses then Russia could attack a NATO member, something Putin has denied.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by framing Western fears of Russian expansion as exaggerated or unfounded, implying negative consequences for the West (e.g., unnecessary escalation or misallocation of resources) without fitting a specific subnarrative definition. It contributes to the broader theme of Western miscalculations leading to adverse outcomes."

      "reasoning": "This quote frames Russia's military actions as a response to Ukrainian aggression (e.g., 'Ukrainian troops had been forced to flee'), implying that Russia is acting defensively rather than as an aggressor. This aligns with the subnarrative that Russia's actions are solely self-defence."

      "reasoning": "This phrase supports the parent narrative by implying that the West and Ukraine are misrepresenting Russia's motives (e.g., 'imperial-style land grab') and that Russia is being falsely accused, which does not fit the specific subnarratives but still reinforces the idea of Russia as a victim of Western narratives."

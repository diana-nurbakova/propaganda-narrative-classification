      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for the continuation of the war away from Russia by suggesting that the U.S. and U.K. are responsible for prolonging the conflict by discouraging Ukraine from accepting a negotiated settlement."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia’s minefields, artillery, and punishing glide bombs have not only kept Ukrainian forces from advancing but left them struggling to hold their positions along the current front line. Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights the military and industrial superiority of Russia over the West, implying that Western support for Ukraine is futile and may lead to further losses or strategic disadvantages."

      "evidence_quote": "Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law that sought to boost conscription rates by making it easier for the government to find and identify draft-eligible men. But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote undermines Ukraine's legitimacy and governance by portraying its conscription efforts as desperate and morally questionable, including the use of prisoners and restrictions on citizens."

      "evidence_quote": "So, accepting Russia’s offer to move this conflict from the battlefield to the negotiation table is almost certainly the best chance Ukraine will get to hold onto the eastern territory they still control.",
      "reasoning": "This statement speculates about the potential outcome of the war, suggesting that Ukraine's best option is to negotiate based on current battlefield lines, implying a likely Russian advantage."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by blaming the West and Ukraine for escalating the conflict, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It emphasizes the role of external actors in prolonging the war rather than holding Russia accountable for the invasion."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the U.S. and U.K. prioritized their own strategic interests (e.g., weakening Russia) over Ukraine's immediate well-being, implying they do not genuinely care about Ukraine's fate but only about their own geopolitical goals."

      "evidence_quote": "All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.",
      "reasoning": "This statement frames Western actions (e.g., allowing Ukraine to strike inside Russia, testing ICBMs) as disproportionate and reckless, aligning with the subnarrative that the West is overreacting to Russia's actions."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Biden called Russian president Vladamir Putin a tyrant who invaded Ukraine simply because he is 'bent on domination.' Biden then renewed one of his favorite tropes, asserting that if Ukraine falls, its people will be subjugated, its neighbors will be in immediate danger, and all of Europe will be threatened by Putin’s aggressive ambitions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by portraying Western rhetoric (e.g., Biden's depiction of Putin) as hyperbolic and manipulative, but it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives. It contributes to discrediting the West's framing of the conflict without aligning with a defined subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by highlighting the broader negative consequences of the conflict for the West, such as the risk of nuclear escalation, but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It emphasizes the dangers of prolonged conflict without directly addressing sanctions or refugee flows."

      "evidence_quote": "the US then test-fired two nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles—launching them four thousand miles from California to the Marshall Islands.",
      "reasoning": "This statement amplifies war-related fears by highlighting nuclear missile tests, which contributes to the overall narrative of escalating tensions but does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative definitions."

      "evidence_quote": "Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law that sought to boost conscription rates by making it easier for the government to find and identify draft-eligible men. But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays the Ukrainian government as desperate and draconian in its policies, particularly regarding conscription, which delegitimizes its leadership and decision-making, fitting the subnarrative definition."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West",
      "evidence_quote": "But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.",

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv. The Ukrainians have, so far, been able to prevent the Russians from advancing and seizing all the territory that Moscow now claims. But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays Ukraine as having no viable path to success or positive future, emphasizing the inevitability of failure, which matches the subnarrative definition."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "What makes Ukraine’s situation even more tragic is how easily it could have been avoided. One month after Russia invaded in early 2022, both sides reached an agreement where Russia would pull back to preinvasion boundaries and, in return, Ukraine would agree to not seek NATO membership. The deal could have put an end to the fighting and handed Kyiv control of all the land Russia had just seized.",
      "reasoning": "This argument supports the parent narrative by implying Ukraine's leadership made poor decisions (rejecting a favorable deal) but does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided. It is distinct evidence that discredits Ukraine without aligning with the predefined categories."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "Putin is showing this interest even though the Russian military is in a strong position that seems likely to get even stronger.",
      "reasoning": "While the quote does not directly claim the Russian army is collapsing, the surrounding context emphasizes Russia's military strength, artillery dominance, and production capabilities, which indirectly counters any narrative of collapse. However, the parent narrative is still supported by the broader argument that Ukraine is weakening, which implies Russia's relative strength. This does not fit the subnarrative definition precisely, so it is not classified here."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Russian army will lose all the occupied territories",
      "evidence_quote": "Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly states that Ukraine lacks the capability to drive Russian forces out of all occupied territories, which directly contradicts the subnarrative of Russia losing all occupied territories. Thus, this subnarrative is not present."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing",
      "evidence_quote": "Russia’s minefields, artillery, and punishing glide bombs have not only kept Ukrainian forces from advancing but left them struggling to hold their positions along the current front line. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers that no amount of foreign aid or equipment transfers can do anything to alleviate... As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.",
      "reasoning": "The text describes the Ukrainian military as struggling to hold positions, facing severe manpower shortages, and relying on older conscripts, which aligns with the definition of the Ukrainian army experiencing a significant decline in effectiveness and strength."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine’s leverage over Russia has only diminished... Even with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv. The Ukrainians have, so far, been able to prevent the Russians from advancing and seizing all the territory that Moscow now claims. But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.",
      "reasoning": "The text speculates about war outcomes by suggesting Ukraine's diminishing leverage, inability to reclaim territory, and the unsustainability of its current defensive posture. While this supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives, as it focuses on broader strategic and long-term weaknesses rather than a specific collapse or territorial loss prediction."

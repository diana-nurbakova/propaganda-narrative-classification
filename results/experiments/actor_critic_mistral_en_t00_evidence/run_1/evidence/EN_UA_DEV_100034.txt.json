    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine.",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not explicitly praise Russia, it implicitly contrasts Russia as the 'aggressor' in a way that could be interpreted as framing Russia as a powerful adversary whose financial weakening is necessary, indirectly acknowledging its strength or threat level."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "The $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the adequacy of Western financial support and implies that Western diplomatic or financial planning (e.g., IMF estimates) is insufficient or deceptive, aligning with the narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote predicts dire consequences for Western cities if Ukraine does not receive adequate support, framing the war as a direct threat to Western security and well-being, which aligns with the narrative of negative consequences for the West."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants. The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine, and, first and foremost, Ukraine's membership in NATO.",
      "reasoning": "This statement excessively lauds the 'free world' (a term often used to refer to Western democracies) by portraying it as united, morally superior, and essential to Ukraine's victory, which aligns with the narrative of overpraising the West."
    }

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "The quote implicitly praises Russian military capabilities by framing them as a significant threat that requires substantial countermeasures, thereby indirectly highlighting the scale and destructive power of Russia's military."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "In 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default.",
      "reasoning": "While the text primarily criticizes Russia's actions, the mention of Russia's 'initial invasion' and its economic impact on Ukraine subtly acknowledges Russia's capacity to destabilize a nation, which aligns with the parent narrative of praising Russia but does not fit any specific subnarrative."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests",
      "evidence_quote": "Some believe that since Ukraine receives large amounts of international aid, it can be used to settle with bondholders. However, over two-thirds of financial assistance arrives as loans to be redeemed.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that Western financial assistance is primarily structured as loans (which Ukraine must repay with interest), implying that the West is prioritizing its own financial interests over Ukraine's immediate needs and survival. This aligns with the subnarrative that the West is only interested in Ukraine for its own benefits."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting",
      "evidence_quote": "According to the current International Monetary Fund-supported program (Q2, 2023 – Q1, 2027), Ukraine’s need for external financial assistance is estimated at $122 billion. However, over two years of the full-scale war, partners have already disbursed $100 billion annually. Therefore, the $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs.",
      "reasoning": "This quote argues that the West's financial demands or expectations for Ukraine's debt restructuring are disproportionate or exaggerated compared to the actual needs, implying an overreaction. This supports the subnarrative that the West is reacting in a disproportionate manner."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine. We need long-term financial assistance, export facilitation, and energy recovery.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives, it subtly reinforces the parent narrative by implying that the West's current efforts (sanctions, financial assistance) are insufficient or not effectively coordinated, thus discrediting Western diplomacy indirectly."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire",
      "evidence_quote": "It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that if Ukraine does not receive sufficient financial support (including debt restructuring), the conflict could escalate and directly harm Western cities, implying that Western inaction or insufficient support could lead to negative consequences for the West itself. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western policies (or lack thereof) could backfire."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants. [...] Democracy and a just world order are the pillars of global economic sustainability, ensuring investment safety and security and investor profits worldwide.",
      "reasoning": "This broader argument frames Ukraine's struggle as essential to the West's security and economic stability, implying that failure to support Ukraine would have dire consequences for the West. While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives provided, hence the use of 'Other'."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history",
      "evidence_quote": "Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly portrays Ukraine and the Western-aligned 'free world' as morally superior and aligned with justice and progress, contrasting them with 'dictators and tyrants' (implied to be Russia). This aligns with the subnarrative's definition of portraying Western actions as morally superior."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support",
      "evidence_quote": "The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine, and, first and foremost, Ukraine's membership in NATO.",
      "reasoning": "This quote emphasizes the 'unity of the free world' and 'unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine,' suggesting widespread and strong international backing for Western policies and actions, which fits the subnarrative's definition."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Overpraising the West: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by framing Western support for Ukraine as essential to protecting the 'civilized world' from Russian aggression, but it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. It overpraises the West by implying its moral and security leadership without explicitly claiming moral superiority or international support."

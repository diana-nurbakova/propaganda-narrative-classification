      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.",
      "reasoning": "This quote shifts blame for Germany's economic struggles away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and instead attributes the negative consequences to Western sanctions and the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines, implying that the West is responsible for the crisis."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error. While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes Western (specifically German) leadership and policies, portraying them as incompetent, hypocritical, and self-destructive while contrasting them with the pragmatic approaches of non-Western countries like China."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Negative Consequences for the West",
      "evidence_quote": "The German economy, the fourth-largest in the world, has ground to a standstill. There is no growth. Manufacturing is depressed, trade is weak, inflation is high, and jobs are scarce. Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights adverse economic outcomes for Germany (a Western nation), attributing its decline to flawed policies and external pressures, which aligns with the narrative of predicting or reporting negative consequences for the West."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "facing intense pressure from green politicians and evangelists of a looming climate apocalypse",
      "reasoning": "This phrase implies that climate change narratives are driven by ideological actors (e.g., 'evangelists') rather than factual reporting, subtly undermining trust in media and institutional messaging about climate issues."

      "evidence_quote": "Despite the stark reality on the ground, the nation’s leaders say they remain committed to eliminate coal by 2030 as part of their long-term objective to achieve 'net-zero emissions.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that German leaders are pursuing a hidden agenda ('net-zero emissions') that prioritizes ideological goals over economic and practical realities, implying a secretive or manipulative scheme by powerful groups."

      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly shifts blame for Germany's economic struggles onto the 'sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West,' portraying the West as the aggressors responsible for the conflict's consequences rather than Russia, the invader."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "Germany’s beleaguered citizens appear to have had enough of this disaster. Political change is in the winds. The populist conservative party, Alternative for Germany, has just emerged as Germany’s second strongest party, polling at 20 percent support nationwide and more than one-third in some regions. One of the party’s main selling points is that it’s 'an aggressive opponent of the government’s energy and climate policy.'",
      "reasoning": "While this passage does not directly blame Ukraine or the West, it frames Germany's economic crisis as a consequence of misguided policies tied to external pressures (e.g., climate goals and energy dependencies), implicitly supporting the parent narrative by suggesting that Germany's suffering is due to factors beyond its control, including geopolitical tensions (e.g., the war). This aligns with the broader theme of deflecting responsibility from Russia."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the West's response to Russia's actions (sanctions and other measures) is disproportionate and harmful, particularly to Germany, implying an overreaction."

While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that Western (specifically German) leaders are prioritizing abstract global goals (e.g., climate policy) over the well-being of their own citizens, suggesting that their support for Ukraine (via sanctions and energy policies) is not genuine but rather self-serving."

      "evidence_quote": "Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.",
      "reasoning": "This quote highlights disparities within the EU, suggesting that member states have differing levels of vulnerability and response to the energy crisis, which implies division rather than unity."

One of the party’s main selling points is that it’s 'an aggressive opponent of the government’s energy and climate policy.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by implying that Western (German) leadership is out of touch with its citizens and that internal political backlash is a consequence of failed policies. However, it does not fit neatly into any of the predefined subnarratives, so it is classified under 'Other.'"

      "evidence_quote": "As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing. As a result, Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attributes Germany's economic struggles, particularly high electricity prices, to the Western sanctions regime against Russia. It frames the sanctions as a cause of negative consequences for the West (Germany), aligning with the subnarrative definition."

      "evidence_quote": "Germany has just recorded its third consecutive quarter of recession, marked by negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The central bank expects the rest of the year to be no better. Germany has recently experienced its highest rate of inflation in a quarter of a century... German manufacturing is facing 'its sharpest slump ... since May 2020'—that is, when the entire world was locked down.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote highlights the broader economic decline in Germany, it does not explicitly tie the downturn to sanctions or refugee flows. Instead, it catastrophizes the overall negative consequences for the West (Germany) due to a combination of factors, including energy policy and geopolitical decisions, which supports the parent narrative but does not fit the specific subnarratives provided."

      "reasoning": "The text implies that Western (including German) media and leadership are promoting a misguided 'green' agenda that harms the economy, while ignoring the actions of other countries like China. This aligns with the subnarrative that Western media is an instrument of propaganda, pushing a narrative that serves ulterior motives rather than objective truth."

      "evidence_quote": "The German government’s position is that this increased use of coal was 'a last resort and short-term backup to secure energy supply' amid the emergency. Despite the stark reality on the ground, the nation’s leaders say they remain committed to eliminate coal by 2030 as part of their long-term objective to achieve 'net-zero emissions.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that German leaders are ignoring 'the stark reality on the ground' and continuing to push a narrative (net-zero emissions) that the text portrays as harmful and disconnected from economic realities. This supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media (or institutional narratives) but does not fit neatly into the provided specific subnarratives, hence the use of 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that the sanctions regime and the sabotage of Nord Stream are part of a broader, hidden agenda by powerful groups (e.g., the U.S. and Western elites) to weaken Germany or control its energy supply, aligning with the parent narrative of secret schemes by powerful groups."

      "evidence_quote": "While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.",
      "reasoning": "This implies that German leaders are either complicit in or manipulated by a hidden agenda (e.g., globalist climate policies) that prioritizes symbolic actions over national economic interests, suggesting a secret scheme by powerful groups to undermine Germany."

      "subnarrative_name": "URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders? Why should German industry be sacrificed to benefit other economies at the expense of their own?",
      "reasoning": "This rhetorical question frames German leadership as either incompetent or acting in service of external, unseen forces (e.g., globalist interests), reinforcing the idea of hidden plots by powerful groups working against Germany's sovereignty."

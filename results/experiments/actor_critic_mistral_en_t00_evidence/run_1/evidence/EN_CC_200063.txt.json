      "evidence_quote": "The SEC must stop overreaching in this area and allow private ordering under corporate law to reestablish shareholder proposals as ways to enhance economic efficiency rather than diminish it.",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the regulatory approach of the SEC regarding climate-related shareholder proposals, implying that such policies are economically detrimental and overreach, which aligns with the definition of criticizing the effectiveness and economic impact of climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly challenges the competence and integrity of the SEC, framing its regulatory approach as 'lawless,' which fits the definition of criticizing institutions and authorities in relation to climate change."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "The shareholder proposal process has gone too far. How else to interpret the proposal recently sponsored by the climate activist investors Arjuna Capital and Follow This at ExxonMobil...",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the motives and impact of climate activist investors, portraying their actions as excessive and disruptive, which aligns with the definition of criticizing the climate movement."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote implies that the proposed emission reduction targets would force ExxonMobil to abandon significant business operations, indirectly criticizing the feasibility and economic impact of transitioning to greener technologies or practices."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "The text suggests that climate-related shareholder proposals, driven by regulatory overreach, are ineffective in achieving meaningful outcomes, as they bypass corporate governance structures and do not align with economic efficiency."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly argues that implementing the climate proposal would force ExxonMobil to abandon significant economic investments and reduce operations, implying a negative economic impact."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The shareholder proposal process has gone too far... leaving unaltered for now the troubling manner in which the SEC oversees its shareholder-proposal process.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes climate-related shareholder proposals and the regulatory framework supporting them but does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative by implying that climate policies are disruptive to corporate governance without specifying ineffectiveness or economic harm."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly criticizes the SEC, a national governmental authority, for its handling of the shareholder proposal process, framing its regulatory approach as 'permissive and arguably lawless.' This aligns with the definition of criticizing national governments' role in climate-related policies or governance."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "We argue that the SEC must stop overreaching in this area and allow private ordering under corporate law to reestablish shareholder proposals as ways to enhance economic efficiency rather than diminish it.",
      "reasoning": "While this quote also criticizes the SEC, it introduces a broader argument about institutional overreach and the need to restore authority to corporate law, which does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It supports the parent narrative of criticizing institutions but extends beyond the specific focus on climate policy handling by national governments."

    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "The quote suggests that the climate movement's demands are exaggerated and unrealistic, implying that the activists are pushing for extreme measures without considering practical business consequences. This aligns with the definition of portraying the climate movement as alarmist."
    },

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the climate movement's influence on regulatory processes, suggesting that their actions undermine corporate law and governance. While it supports the parent narrative, it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives, thus qualifying for 'Other'."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "To accomplish such an aggressive timetable, ExxonMobil would probably have to give up its planned $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and severely contract current operations.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that implementing the proposed emission reductions would impose significant financial costs on ExxonMobil, including abandoning a major acquisition and scaling back operations, which aligns with the subnarrative that renewable or green energy initiatives are too expensive or financially burdensome."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The submission of this proposal is a direct result of the SEC’s increasingly permissive and arguably lawless regulatory approach to shareholder proposals.",
      "reasoning": "This statement criticizes the regulatory framework supporting green initiatives (shareholder proposals on emissions) but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of danger, unreliability, or cost. It supports the parent narrative by implying that green technology advocacy is enabled by overreach or flawed governance, which is distinct from the other subnarratives."

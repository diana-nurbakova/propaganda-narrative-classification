      "evidence_quote": "Washington 'cannot afford' to allow Russia to achieve victory in the Ukraine conflict as this would mean losing direct access to vast mineral assets.",
      "reasoning": "This statement shifts blame for the conflict by implying that the U.S. (the West) is the primary actor with a vested interest in prolonging the war, rather than acknowledging Russia's role as the invader. The focus is on Western motivations, not Russia's aggression."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting Ukraine",
      "evidence_quote": "'Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly attacks the legitimacy and character of Ukraine's government by labeling it as 'corrupt' and 'neo-Nazi,' which aligns with the definition of discrediting Ukraine."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy",
      "evidence_quote": "Graham is treating Ukraine as a future colony of the US with his comments on the ownership of the country's natural resources... 'The fate of the colonies is always the same: the Americans will scoop up all the natural resources of Ukraine in exchange for 'the great honor of being a friend of the United States'.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the U.S. (the West) by portraying it as exploitative and imperialistic, undermining Western diplomatic and economic intentions. It suggests hypocrisy and malice in Western actions."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Praise of Russia",
      "evidence_quote": "Vladimir Dzhabarov, official of the Russian Federation Council, said...",
      "reasoning": "While not overt praise, the inclusion of a Russian official's perspective without counterbalance subtly elevates Russia's narrative as authoritative and legitimate, indirectly praising its stance by giving it a platform."

      "narrative_name": "URW: Distrust towards Media",
      "evidence_quote": "Take a look at Sputnik's infographics to see Ukraine's mineral resources that the West cotes so much.",
      "reasoning": "This statement implies that Western media (or general media) is not providing the full or accurate picture, encouraging the audience to rely on Russian state media (Sputnik) instead, which aligns with the definition of distrust towards media."

'They’re sitting on 10 to $12 trillion of critical minerals in Ukraine. They could be the richest country in all of Europe,' Graham said. 'If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote explicitly frames the U.S. as pursuing its own economic and strategic interests in Ukraine, implying that the West is the true aggressor in the conflict by seeking to control Ukraine's resources rather than acknowledging Russia's role as the invader."

'Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.'",
      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative by further blaming the West for exploiting Ukraine and propping up a corrupt regime, but it does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'Ukraine is the aggressor' or 'The West are the aggressors.' Instead, it expands on the theme of Western culpability in a broader, more ideological manner."

While \"promising Ukrainians mountains of gold, Graham in fact considers it as a future American colony,\" Dzhabarov said.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly claims that the U.S. views Ukraine as a colony and that Ukraine's resources are being controlled or exploited by Western powers, directly aligning with the subnarrative that Ukraine is a puppet of the West."

      "reasoning": "The framing of the entire text suggests that Ukraine's value lies solely in its resources and that the West is fighting for control over them, which supports the parent narrative of discrediting Ukraine but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives. This implies Ukraine has no agency or sovereignty, reinforcing the broader discrediting theme."

'If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that $10 to $12 trillion of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly frames Western support for Ukraine as motivated by access to Ukraine's mineral resources rather than concern for Ukraine's sovereignty or well-being. This directly aligns with the subnarrative that the West is only interested in Ukraine for its own benefits."

'Well, they will feed the corrupt top of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev at the same time.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by further discrediting the West's intentions, portraying it as exploitative and manipulative. However, it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided, as it focuses on colonialist exploitation and corruption rather than the predefined themes like division, weakness, or fatigue."

      "reasoning": "While the quote does not explicitly praise Putin, Dzhabarov is a Russian official, and his critical portrayal of U.S. actions indirectly elevates Russia's moral or political standing by contrast, which aligns with the broader subnarrative of presenting Russian leadership positively."

      "evidence_quote": "Take a look at Sputnik's infographics to see Ukraine's mineral resources that the West cotes so much.",
      "reasoning": "This phrase promotes a Russian state media outlet (Sputnik) and frames the narrative in a way that subtly reinforces Russia's perspective as authoritative and trustworthy, supporting the parent narrative but not fitting any specific subnarrative directly."

      "reasoning": "The text explicitly directs the reader to Sputnik's infographics while implying that Western media (e.g., CBS News) is distorting or omitting the true motives behind the West's involvement in Ukraine. This suggests that Western media is an instrument of propaganda, as it frames the narrative to discredit Western media institutions."

      "reasoning": "This passage supports the parent narrative of distrust towards media by implying that Western political figures and media outlets (e.g., CBS News) are complicit in a manipulative agenda to exploit Ukraine. However, it does not directly discredit Western or Ukrainian media institutions but instead focuses on political motives, which does not fit the specific subnarratives provided. Thus, it qualifies for 'Other'."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home",
      "reasoning": "This quote criticizes the effectiveness and practicality of Garcetti's decision to attend the climate summit in person, implying that the policy action (flying internationally) contradicts the goals of combating climate change and neglects local responsibilities."

    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti joined a U.S. Department of Transportation presentation on 'high-quality urban transportation infrastructure,' though L.A.’s infrastructure is not widely considered 'high-quality.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote challenges the competence and credibility of Garcetti and the institutions he represents by highlighting the discrepancy between his claims about 'high-quality' infrastructure and the reality of L.A.'s infrastructure issues."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the motives and integrity of the climate movement by suggesting that the summit's in-person format is unnecessary and hypocritical, given the environmental cost of travel."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti’s 'Green New Deal' calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses skepticism about the feasibility and acceptance of Garcetti's green technology policies, specifically the transition away from natural gas plants, by highlighting opposition and electoral failure."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "Garcetti joined a U.S. Department of Transportation presentation on 'high-quality urban transportation infrastructure,' though L.A.’s infrastructure is not widely considered 'high-quality.' A proposed high-speed rail between L.A. and San Francisco has been largely canceled, and current passenger rail service from L.A. to San Diego has been suspended because of a potential landslide hazard.",
      "reasoning": "The quote highlights the disconnect between Garcetti's participation in a climate summit promoting 'high-quality urban transportation' and the actual state of Los Angeles' infrastructure, which is described as subpar. This suggests that the policies or efforts being promoted are not achieving their intended goals, aligning with the subnarrative that climate policies are ineffective."

      "reasoning": "The quote implies that Garcetti's climate policies, such as shutting down natural gas plants, face opposition due to potential economic consequences, such as job losses or economic disruption. This aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies have a negative impact on the economy."

It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes Garcetti for prioritizing international climate summits over addressing pressing local issues like crime and homelessness. Additionally, it questions the necessity of in-person attendance, implying hypocrisy or misplaced priorities in climate policy efforts. This supports the parent narrative but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives, warranting the use of 'Other'."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes Mayor Garcetti, a political figure, for his actions related to climate change, implying hypocrisy and neglect of local responsibilities. This aligns with the definition of discrediting political figures in the context of climate change debate."

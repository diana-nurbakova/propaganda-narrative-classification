    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title itself frames the wind energy initiative as a 'ripoff,' implying that the climate policy (offshore wind energy development) is ineffective, wasteful, or economically harmful. This directly questions the economic impact and motives behind climate policies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The use of the term 'ripoff' in the title suggests skepticism or criticism of wind energy technology, portraying it as flawed or overhyped. This aligns with the narrative of expressing skepticism about environmentally friendly technologies."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The framing of the announcement as a 'ripoff' challenges the integrity and competence of the institutions and authorities (e.g., the Department of the Interior, Biden-Harris administration) involved in promoting offshore wind energy. This implies that their actions are not in the public's best interest."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title itself implies that the wind energy initiative is a failure or scam, suggesting that climate policies (in this case, offshore wind energy auctions) are ineffective or misguided in achieving their environmental goals."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are only for profit",
      "evidence_quote": "Today’s sale drew competitive high bids from 5 companies totaling $757.1 million, well exceeding the first lease sales that were held in the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "The emphasis on the high monetary value of the bids and the competitive nature of the auction implies that the primary driver of the policy is financial gain for companies rather than genuine environmental concerns."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The derogatory framing of the policy as a 'ripoff' supports the parent narrative of criticizing climate policies but does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives. It suggests a broader discrediting of the initiative beyond ineffectiveness or profit motives."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is costly",
      "evidence_quote": "The lease sale represents the third major offshore wind lease sale this year and the first ever for the Pacific region. Today’s sale drew competitive high bids from 5 companies totaling $757.1 million, well exceeding the first lease sales that were held in the Atlantic.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the high cost of the offshore wind lease sale ($757.1 million), implying that renewable energy projects are financially burdensome. This aligns with the subnarrative that renewable energy is too expensive for widespread adoption."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title of the text frames the offshore wind energy initiative as a 'ripoff,' suggesting a broader critique of green technologies that does not fit neatly into the other subnarrative categories. This supports the parent narrative but is not captured by the specific subnarratives provided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments",
      "evidence_quote": "The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff…",
      "reasoning": "The title itself, 'The Great California Wind Energy Ripoff,' directly criticizes the national government's (U.S.) handling of wind energy initiatives, implying mismanagement or deceit in the context of climate policy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The Biden-Harris administration believes that to address the climate crisis head on...",
      "reasoning": "While the quote itself is neutral, the framing of the article's title and the use of 'Biden-Harris administration' in a critical context suggests an attempt to discredit the political figures and their approach to climate change policy."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "The interest and success of today’s sale represents a significant milestone toward achieving President Biden’s goal...",
      "reasoning": "The phrase subtly undermines the administration's goals by framing the entire initiative as a 'ripoff' in the title, which supports the parent narrative of criticism but does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives. The tone implies skepticism or disapproval of the government's climate policies without direct criticism of specific entities."

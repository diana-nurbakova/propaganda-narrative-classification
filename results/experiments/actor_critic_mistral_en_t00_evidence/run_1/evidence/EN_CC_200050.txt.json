      "evidence_quote": "Addressing the world’s energy and climate needs will be a balancing act... the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote questions the feasibility and economic impact of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, aligning with the definition of criticizing climate policies by highlighting potential negative consequences."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "Banks have been increasingly investing in green energy, investing $0.81 in the sector for every $1 spent on fossil fuels in 2021... The same report found that Deutsche invested $2.2 in green energy for every $1 in traditional fossil fuels.",
      "reasoning": "The inclusion of the parenthetical remark '(RELATED: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Shatter Record Despite Green Investments)' and the emphasis on banks' green investments implicitly challenges the competence or effectiveness of institutions and authorities driving climate policies."

      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Deutsche bank in particular drew some criticism from activist groups that considered the move to be insufficient, since it did not include similar cutbacks in oil and gas... Activist groups had previously hailed the decision from major British bank HSBC in December to not fund new oil and gas investments",
      "reasoning": "This quote portrays the climate movement as demanding and never satisfied, challenging the motives and impact of activist groups by highlighting their criticism of incremental progress."

      "evidence_quote": "the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This statement expresses skepticism about the viability of green technologies (renewables) as a quick replacement for fossil fuels, aligning with the definition of controversy about green technologies."

      "evidence_quote": "The Federal Reserve launched a pilot program in January, requiring the six largest U.S. banks... submit data regarding the impact of climate change on their investment portfolios by July 31.",
      "reasoning": "The mention of the Federal Reserve's involvement in climate-related financial regulations suggests that green policies may be used as tools for broader institutional control or geopolitical influence, rather than purely environmental concern."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective",
      "evidence_quote": "(RELATED: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Shatter Record Despite Green Investments)",
      "reasoning": "The parenthetical reference to record-breaking carbon dioxide emissions despite green investments directly implies that climate policies (or green investments) are not achieving their intended environmental goals, aligning with the definition of this subnarrative."

      "reasoning": "This quote from Citigroup's CEO highlights the economic challenges and potential negative impacts of transitioning away from fossil fuels too quickly, particularly for developing nations, which aligns with the subnarrative that climate policies harm the economy."

      "reasoning": "While this quote does not fit the specific subnarratives of ineffectiveness, economic harm, or profit-driven motives, it subtly supports the parent narrative by framing the shift toward green energy as a forced or disproportionate reallocation of resources, which could be interpreted as a critique of climate policies without fitting neatly into the other categories."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities",
      "evidence_quote": "Both banks are founding members of the United Nations’ Net Zero Banking Alliance, which requires its 126 members to set goals and disclose financial data related to their efforts to reduce the emissions of their lending portfolio to net zero by 2050.",
      "reasoning": "The text implicitly criticizes the influence of the United Nations and its Net Zero Banking Alliance by framing the banks' compliance with its requirements as part of a broader, potentially coercive movement driven by international entities."

Activist groups had previously hailed the decision from major British bank HSBC in December to not fund new oil and gas investments and move to overhaul existing businesses it finances, joining fellow British bank Lloyds.",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the broader institutional and activist-driven pressure on banks to adopt climate policies, but it does not fit neatly into the predefined subnarratives. It highlights dissatisfaction with institutional responses to climate change without directly targeting a specific entity or figure."

      "evidence_quote": "U.S. banks, such as JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — all members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance — have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios... New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "The text suggests that activist investors and political figures are using financial leverage (e.g., threats to pull pension funds) to coerce banks into adopting climate policies, implying ulterior motives or unethical influence rather than purely environmental concerns."

      "evidence_quote": "the global economy still runs primarily on oil and natural gas and many developing nations have neither the resources nor the infrastructure to make a quick shift to renewables.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that renewable energy sources are not yet capable of replacing fossil fuels due to infrastructure and resource limitations, implying they are unreliable for widespread adoption."

U.S. banks... have faced pressure from activist investors to be more aggressive with their plans to cut fossil fuels from their investment portfolios.",

      "evidence_quote": "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander in January filed a series of such shareholder resolutions in January, and threatened to pull pension funds from investment managers who failed to support the resolutions.",
      "reasoning": "This quote suggests that climate-related financial pressures, such as shareholder resolutions and threats to withdraw funds, are being used as tools to coerce banks into compliance with green policies. This aligns with the subnarrative that international or institutional climate-related relations are economically abusive or exploitative."

      "reasoning": "This quote implies that green policies, particularly those pushed by Western financial institutions, disregard the developmental realities of poorer nations, potentially forcing them into disadvantageous positions. This aligns with the subnarrative that green initiatives are a form of neo-colonialism, where developed nations exert control over developing ones."

      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by suggesting that regulatory bodies (like the Federal Reserve) are using climate policies to influence financial institutions' behavior, which could be seen as a form of geopolitical leverage. However, it does not fit neatly into the other specific subnarratives, warranting its classification under 'Other'."

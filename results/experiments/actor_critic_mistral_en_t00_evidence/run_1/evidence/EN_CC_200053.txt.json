But he demoted Sharma and climate minister Graham Stuart, who have been stripped of their Cabinet seats.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly criticizes the UK government's inconsistent and contradictory handling of climate policies, including demoting key climate figures, which aligns with the definition of disapproving national governments' approach to climate change."

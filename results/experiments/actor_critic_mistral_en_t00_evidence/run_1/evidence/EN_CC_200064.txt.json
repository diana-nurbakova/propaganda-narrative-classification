      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the Swedish Dance Show",
      "reasoning": "The text uses derogatory terms like 'radical climate activist' and 'eco-loon' to describe the activists, which challenges the motives and integrity of the climate movement. The framing of the event as a disruptive stunt rather than a legitimate protest further criticizes the movement."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The activist group Restore Wetlands claimed responsibility for the act, saying: 'Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.'",
      "reasoning": "While the text does not directly criticize institutions, the inclusion of the activist group's statement—without counterbalance or contextual framing—indirectly challenges the competence of authorities and institutions to address climate concerns effectively, implying their actions are insufficient or misguided."

  "subnarratives": [
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist",
      "evidence_quote": "The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.",
      "reasoning": "The quote from the activist group's statement suggests an extreme, catastrophic framing of climate change, which aligns with the subnarrative that the climate movement exaggerates the severity of the issue for dramatic effect."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "A radical climate activist was knocked on his rear end by a camera crane operator after a group stormed the Swedish Dance Show... The three activists jumped onto the stage, stood in front of the studio camera, released yellow paint powder, and unfurled a large banner... their stunt was short lived, with a large camera on a crane quickly swooping in and knocking down a male activist.",
      "reasoning": "The text describes the activists' actions as disruptive, radical, and unnecessary, portraying them in a negative light. This supports the parent narrative of criticizing the climate movement but does not fit neatly into the specific subnarratives of 'alarmist,' 'corrupt,' or 'ad hominem attacks.' The framing implies the movement's tactics are counterproductive or misguided."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures",
      "evidence_quote": "The activist group Restore Wetlands claimed responsibility for the act, saying: 'Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.'",
      "reasoning": "The quote criticizes the perceived extremism and disruptive tactics of the activist group, which can be interpreted as discrediting political or activist organizations involved in the climate change debate. The framing of their actions as unreasonable and disruptive aligns with the subnarrative of criticizing political organizations and figures."
    },
    {
      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other",
      "evidence_quote": "One of those who jumped in to protect the dancers, former Let’s Dance contestant Rickard Sjöberg, told Aftonbladet that he wished he had acted sooner, given that Kalla is currently pregnant. 'I think that in this case it became dangerous because it happened in the middle of a dance where a heavily pregnant woman is participating. Then it becomes very important to do something, and I wish I had intervened earlier.'",
      "reasoning": "This quote supports the parent narrative by criticizing the activists' actions as reckless and endangering others, which indirectly questions the legitimacy and responsibility of those who authorize or support such protests. However, it does not fit neatly into any of the specific subnarratives provided, thus qualifying for 'Other'."

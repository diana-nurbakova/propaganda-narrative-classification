      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies",
      "evidence_quote": "Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms... the government 'must be alive' to the 'significant costs' of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "This quote directly questions the effectiveness and economic/environmental impact of climate policies, specifically the push for wind farms, by highlighting the perceived negative consequences (e.g., tree felling, visual impact, wildlife damage)."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities",
      "evidence_quote": "The leftist government of Scotland has admitted to felling nearly 16 million trees on public land in order to make way for supposedly ‘green energy’ wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The text challenges the competence and integrity of the Scottish government by framing their actions as hypocritical (cutting down trees for 'green' energy) and implying poor decision-making."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Controversy about green technologies",
      "evidence_quote": "In addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity... The mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people.",
      "reasoning": "This quote expresses skepticism and criticism of wind turbines (a green technology) by highlighting their environmental and social drawbacks, such as reliance on harmful mining practices and ecological damage."
    },
    {
      "narrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate movement",
      "evidence_quote": "Nevertheless, the Scottish government has vowed to continue its 'green energy' push... Renewable energy generated from wind farms is a key element in Scotland’s response to the climate emergency and the shift towards net zero.",
      "reasoning": "While the exact example quote is not present, the broader text criticizes the climate movement's priorities (e.g., 'Green Madness' in the title, emphasis on the downsides of wind farms) and implies that the movement ignores trade-offs and local concerns, aligning with the definition of challenging the motives or impact of the climate movement."

      "subnarrative_name": "CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy",
      "evidence_quote": "Mr Kerr said: ‘Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,’ adding that the government ‘must be alive’ to the ‘significant costs’ of the installation of massive wind turbines.",
      "reasoning": "The quote explicitly mentions the 'significant costs' of wind turbine installation, implying that climate policies lead to negative economic outcomes, particularly for rural communities and businesses."

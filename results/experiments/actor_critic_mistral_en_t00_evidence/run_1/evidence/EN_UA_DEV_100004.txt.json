They are the main carriers of Storm Shadow / SCALP cruise missiles.",

      "reasoning": "This quote subtly supports the parent narrative by implying that Ukrainian military facilities (and thus Ukraine's war efforts) are legitimate targets, while omitting Russia's role as the aggressor. It does not fit neatly into the other subnarratives but still aligns with the broader theme of deflecting blame."

More explosions thundered in the area of the notorious Starokonstantinov airfield in the Khmelnitsk region.",
      "reasoning": "The text highlights the scale, effectiveness, and precision of Russian military strikes, portraying them as powerful and successful. This directly aligns with the subnarrative of praising Russia's military might by emphasizing its operational capabilities and impact."

      "reasoning": "The text implies that Western-supplied Storm Shadow missiles are being used by Ukraine to attack Russian territory, framing the West's military support as enabling disproportionate or escalatory actions by Ukraine. This aligns with the subnarrative that the West is overreacting to Russia's actions."

      "reasoning": "By highlighting the use of Western-supplied missiles (Storm Shadow/SCALP) without mentioning any concern for Ukrainian sovereignty or civilian welfare, the text suggests that the West is only interested in Ukraine as a tool to weaken Russia, disregarding Ukraine's fate. This supports the subnarrative that the West prioritizes its own interests over Ukraine's well-being."

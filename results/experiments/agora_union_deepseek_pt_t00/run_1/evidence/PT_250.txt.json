      "reasoning": "This statement directly criticizes Western countries, suggesting their efforts to pressure Russia (through sanctions) were ineffective and based on an overestimation of their own capabilities, which discredits Western policy and diplomatic actions."

      "reasoning": "This quote praises Russia's resilience and economic performance in the face of Western pressure, supporting the parent narrative of praising Russia. It does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarratives about military might, Putin, peace/security, or explicit national support for the invasion, but it is a clear positive statement about Russia's strategic and economic strength."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly presents Western countries as having overestimated their own power and the effectiveness of their pressure (sanctions) on Russia, which aligns with the definition of portraying the West as non-potent or weaker than it believed itself to be."

      "reasoning": "This statement, in the context of the article, supports the parent narrative of discrediting Western diplomacy by implying that Western sanctions (a diplomatic tool) have backfired, strengthening Russia's partnership with China instead of isolating it. This argument discredits the West's strategic approach but does not fit neatly into the more specific subnarrative definitions provided."

      "reasoning": "This quote directly states that Western pressure (sanctions) was overestimated and ineffective, while Russia's economy performed well due to stable oil exports, implying the sanctions backfired by failing to cripple Russia and instead solidifying its alternative partnerships."

      "reasoning": "This statement supports the parent narrative of negative consequences for the West by highlighting a specific strategic shift where Russia's energy exports are redirected to China, strengthening the Russia-China alliance and reducing Western economic influence, which is a negative consequence not covered by the more specific subnarratives."

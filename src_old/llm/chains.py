    You are an expert journalist and linguist generating diverse, high-quality training data.
    Your objective is to write multiple, distinct news-style texts that are all clear examples of the provided narrative.

    **Narrative to Generate:**
    {narrative_name}

    **Narrative Definition:**
    {narrative_def}
    
    **Example:**
    {narrative_example}

    **Your Task:**
    Generate a batch of **{num_examples} distinct and diverse texts** that all exemplify the narrative above. To ensure diversity, write each text from a **different persona or perspective**.

    Here are some example personas to adopt for each text (You are not limited to these, feel free to create your own):
    - A skeptical financial journalist focusing on economic angles.
    - An optimistic technologist writing for a tech publication.
    - A concerned environmental scientist from a research institute.
    - A conservative political commentator.
    - A liberal policy advisor.
    - A local news reporter focusing on community impact.
    - An international relations expert.
    - A historian providing context.

    **Crucial Constraints for EACH text:**
    1.  **Style:** Each text must be in a formal, journalistic style appropriate to its persona.
    2.  **Structure:** Each text must be between 300 and 500 words long. The length of articles is important to ensure they are substantial enough to convey the narrative effectively.
    3.  **Precision:** Each text MUST clearly exemplify the target narrative.
    4.  **Factual Integrity:** DO NOT invent specific, verifiable details (names, dates, stats), if possible use them actually.
    5.  **Diversity:** Ensure each text is distinct in perspective, tone, and focus.
